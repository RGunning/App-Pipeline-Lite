considered absurdities, and were ridiculed as "painted hearses." The

THE AIR ENGINE.


Numerous attempts have been made to supersede steam as a motive power,
with the view to avoid the loss of heat by its absorption in the steam
in a latent state. Mercury vapour and spirit vapour have been tried,
in the expectation that as they possess much less capacity for heat,
an equal pressure might be obtained, with a diminished loss of heating
power. Several gaseous agents have been applied to the same purpose, of
which carbonic acid gas seemed to present the best prospect of success,
because it becomes expanded with a comparatively small increase of
temperature. None of these attempts to produce a motive power superior
to steam have yet proved successful. They have all, after a short
season of promise, dropped out of notice; and the only one that is
still in the field, struggling for superiority, is the air engine.

The first known air engine was invented by Sir George Cayley, in 1803.
In his engine the air was heated by passing directly through the hot
coals of the furnace, which some engineers yet consider to be the best
mode of expansion; but its operation did not answer expectations. Mr.
D. Stirling, of Dundee, afterwards improved on Sir George Cayley's
plan, and introduced a method of regaining the heat from the expanded
air, after it had done its work in the cylinder, and of applying it to
expand the air again. Engines on this construction have been for some
years working in Scotland, and in 1850 Mr. Stirling took out a patent
for an improvement in the arrangement, which is stated to have been
very successful.

Though Sir George Cayley and Mr. Stirling were the first in the field
as inventors of air engines, the name of Mr. Ericsson, an American,
is more closely associated with the invention, as he has for many
years been conducting experiments on a large scale, and has tried his
"caloric engine" on land, and on a ship of large burthen, built for the
purpose.

The principle and the working of Mr. Ericsson's caloric engine is
nearly the same as Mr. Stirling's; but as it has been brought most
prominently into notice, we shall direct attention more particularly
to its construction and performances. Mr. Ericsson obtained a patent
for his caloric engine in this country in 1833, and a subsequent patent
for improvements on it was taken out in 1851. During those years, and
to a late period, he was indefatigably working out the principle, and
numerous highly favourable reports have from time to time been made of
the results of the experiments; but the advantages to be derived from
the air engine remain nevertheless very questionable.

The object attempted to be gained is to make the same heating power
do its work again and again. Atmospheric air, after being expanded by
passing over an extensive hot surface, exerts the force thus acquired
to raise the piston of a large cylinder, and it is then attempted
to abstract the heat as the air issues out, and to apply it to the
expansion of a further quantity.

The practicability of this plan has undergone much discussion; its
friends and foes being equally confident in their opinions. The
former pronounce it to be one of the most valuable inventions of
the age, being calculated to economize heat, and to give greatly
additional impulse to navigation; whilst its opponents declare that the
calculations are erroneous, the experiments fallacious, and that the
expanded air consumes more heating power than steam.

In one of the favourable notices of Mr. Ericsson's engine in an
American publication, it is thus described:--"Two caloric engines have
been constructed in New York, one of 5-horse power, the other of 60.
The latter has four cylinders; two of 6 feet diameter, placed side by
side, surmounted by two of much smaller size. Within are pistons, so
connected that those in the lower and upper cylinders move together.
A fire is placed under the bottom of the large cylinders, called the
working cylinders; those above are called the supply cylinders. As
the piston in the supply cylinder moves down, valves at the top admit
the air. As they rise, those valves close, and the air passes into
a receiver and regenerator, where it is heated to about 450°, and
entering the next working cylinder, it is further heated by a fire
underneath to 485°. The air is thus expanded to double its volume;
and supposing the supply cylinder to be half the size of the other,
the air, when expanded, will completely fill the larger cylinder. As
the area of the piston of the smaller cylinder will be only half that
of the larger, and as the air will be of the same pressure in both,
the total pressure on the piston of the large cylinder will be double
that on the small one. This surplus furnishes the working power of
the engine. After the air in the working cylinder has forced up the
piston within it, a valve opens; and as the air passes out, the piston
descends by gravity, and cold air rushes in, and fills the supply
cylinder.

"The most striking feature is the regenerator. It is composed of wire
net, placed together to a thickness of about 12 inches. The side
of the regenerator, near the working cylinder, is heated to a high
temperature. The air passes through it before entering the working
cylinder, and becomes heated to 450°. The additional heat of 30° is
communicated by the fire underneath to the large cylinder. The expanded
air forces the cylinder upwards, valves open, and it passes from the
cylinder, and again enters the regenerator. One side of the regenerator
is kept cool by the air on its entering in the opposite direction at
each stroke of the piston; consequently, as the air of the working
cylinder passes out, the wires abstract its heat so effectually, that
when it leaves the regenerator, it has been robbed of all except about
30°. In other words, as the air passes into the working cylinder, it
gradually receives from the regenerator about 450° of heat; and as it
passes out, this is returned to the wires, and it is thus used over and
over again; the only purpose of the fires beneath the cylinders being
to supply the 30° of heat which are lost by radiation and expansion.

"The regenerator in the 60-horse engine measures 26 inches in height
and width. Each disc of wire composing it contains 676 superficial
square inches, and the net has 10 meshes to the inch. Each superficial
inch, therefore, contains 100 meshes, and there are 67,600 in each
disc; and as 200 discs are employed, the regenerator contains
13,520,000 meshes, with an equal number of small spaces between the
discs as there are meshes; therefore, the air is distributed into
27,000,000 of minute cells. The wire in each disc is 1,140 feet long;
and the total length of wire in the regenerator is 41½ miles, or equal
to the surface of four steam boilers, each 40 feet long and 4 feet
diameter."

The accounts received from America of the great success that had
attended the working of Mr. Ericsson's air engine, on the ship
"Ericsson," attracted much attention in this country, and formed
the subject of two evenings' discussion in the Institution of Civil
Engineers. The most prevalent opinion was, that it is impossible to
regain the heating power without corresponding loss of mechanical force
or the addition of heat, and that there must have been some fallacy in
the reports of the work done and of the quantity of fuel consumed.

It is, indeed, evident that nothing approaching the amount of heat
said to have been recovered could be regained by passing through
the regenerator; for as the apparatus becomes heated by the first
portions of air passing through it, the temperature of the quantity
that afterwards passed must at least be equal to that of the heated
wires, and the last portions of air would consequently scarcely part
with any caloric to the regenerator, previously heated to nearly
its own temperature. Experience has since proved that the notion of
regaining the heat by the regenerator was fallacious, for in the
last improvements in Mr. Ericsson's engine, it is stated that the
regenerator has been abandoned, and the plan has been adopted of
cooling the air as it issues from the large cylinder, by passing it
through tubes surrounded by cold water, and then using the same air
over again.

One great practical inconvenience in the use of the air engine was the
necessity of having enormously large cylinders to attain the required
power, with the low amount of pressure that can be procured by the
expansion of the air. The consequent friction increased the loss of
power, and the difficulty of lubricating the pistons added to the
practical objections to the air engine. To overcome these objections,
the air in Mr. Stirling's engine is compressed before it is heated, by
which means an equal amount of pressure is obtained on a smaller piston.

The air engine would in many respects possess advantages over the steam
engine, if it could be worked economically. The space occupied by the
boilers would be saved, and the danger of explosions would be avoided;
for hot air does not scald, and the quantity at any time expanded would
be too small to do much injury.

A patent has since been obtained by Messrs. Napier and Rankine, for
improvements in the air engine, which they anticipated would remove
the objections that have been raised to the engines of Stirling and
Ericsson. The heating surface has been greatly increased by employing
tubes; and other defects in the former engines, to which their want
of complete success is attributed, have been remedied, so that Mr.
Rankine, in his description of the improvements at the meeting of the
British Association at Liverpool, confidently anticipated to effect a
great saving of heating power, combined with the other advantages of
the air engine. He estimated the consumption of fuel by a theoretically
perfect air engine on Mr. Stirling's principle at 0·37 lbs. per horse
power per hour; whilst a theoretically perfect steam engine would
consume 1·86 lbs. The actual average consumption of a steam engine
is, however, 4 lbs. of fuel per horse power per hour, and the actual
consumption of Stirling's engine is stated by Mr. Rankine to have
been 2·20 lbs, and that of Ericsson's 2·80 lbs. It appears from this
statement, therefore, that the air engines of Messrs. Stirling and
Ericsson are superior in point of economy of fuel to steam engines; and
if Mr. Rankine's anticipations of the superiority of his air engine be
realized, it will effect still greater economy. In Messrs. Napier and
Rankine's engine, the air is compressed before expansion, so that the
size of the cylinders may be reduced to even smaller dimensions than
the cylinders of steam engines of equal power.




PHOTOGRAPHY.


The power we now possess of fixing the transient impression of the rays
of light, and of retaining the beautiful images of the camera obscura,
is perhaps the most astonishing of the present age of wonders. Effects
similar to those of the electric telegraph, of steam navigation, of
dissolving views, and of other wondrous realizations of inventive
genius, had been anticipated in growing tales of Eastern romance
centuries ago; but the most fanciful imagination had not conceived the
possibility of making Nature her own artist, and of producing, in the
twinkling of an eye, a permanent representation of all the objects
comprehended within the range of vision.

Such an idea could scarcely have occurred until after the invention of
the camera obscura; but when looking at the beautiful pictures focused
on the screen of that instrument, it became an object of longing desire
to fix them there.

To trace the history of Photography from its earliest beginnings, we
must go back to the days of the alchemists, who were the discoverers
of the influence of light in darkening the salts of silver, on which
all photographic processes on paper depend. That property of light was
noticed in 1566, and it induced the speculative philosophers of that
day to conceive that luminous rays contained a sulphurous principle
which transmitted the forms of matter. Homberg, more than a century
afterwards, misled by this action of the sun's rays, supposed that they
insinuated themselves into the particles of bodies, and increased their
weight; and Sir Isaac Newton also entertained a similar opinion.

The influence of the solar rays in facilitating the crystallization of
saltpetre and sal ammoniac, was shown by Petit in 1722; and in 1777,
the distinguished chemist Scheele discovered that the violet rays of
the spectrum possess greater power in producing those changes than
any other. A solution of nitrate of silver, then called "the acid of
silver," was known to be peculiarly susceptible to the action of those
rays. The experiment by which it was illustrated consisted in pouring
the solution on chalk, which became blackened by exposure to light.
These discoveries were made by Scheele in his endeavours to find in
light the source of "phlogiston"--that _ignis fatuus_ of the chemists
of the last century. We thus perceive, in the first steps towards the
invention of Photography, one of the many instances of the discovery of
truth in the search after error.

At the beginning of the present century, Mr. Wedgwood, the celebrated
porcelain manufacturer, undertook a series of experiments to fix the
images of the camera, assisted by Mr. (afterwards Sir Humphry) Davy.
They so far succeeded as to impress the images on the screen, but
unfortunately they had not the power of preserving the paper from
being blackened all over when exposed for a short time to the light.
"Nothing," said Sir Humphry Davy, in his account of these experiments,
"but a method of preventing the unshaded parts of the delineation from
being coloured by exposure to light is wanting to render this process
as useful as it is elegant."

It was in June, 1802, that Mr. T. Wedgwood published "an account of a
method of copying paintings on glass, and of making profiles by the
agency of light; with observations by H. Davy." Mr. Wedgwood made use
of white paper or white leather, moistened with a solution of nitrate
of silver. The following description of the process, contributed to
the "Journals of the Royal Institution" by Davy, will be read with
interest, as showing how closely these experiments approximated to
the photogenic process, invented by Mr. Talbot thirty-six years
afterwards:--

"White paper or white leather moistened with a solution of nitrate
of silver undergoes no change in a dark place; but on being exposed
to daylight, it speedily changes colour, and after passing through
different shades of grey and brown, becomes at length nearly black;
the alterations of colour take place more speedily in proportion as
the light is more intense. In the direct rays of the sun, two or three
minutes are sufficient to produce the full effect. In the shade,
several hours are required; and light transmitted through different
coloured glasses acts on it with different degrees of intensity.
Thus it is found that red rays, or the common sunbeams passed through
red glass, have very little action on it. Yellow or green are more
efficacious; but blue and violet light produce the most decided and
powerful effects.

"When the shadow of any figure is thrown on the prepared surfaced, the
part concealed by it remains white, and the other parts speedily become
dark. For copying paintings on glass, the solution should be applied on
leather, and in this case it is more readily acted on than when paper
is used. When the colour has been once fixed on leather or paper, it
cannot be removed by the application of water, or water and soap, and
it is in a high degree permanent. The copy of a painting or a profile,
immediately after being taken, must be kept in a dark place. It may,
indeed, be examined in the shade, but in this case the exposure should
only be for a few minutes; by the light of candles or lamps, it is
not sensibly affected. No attempts that have been made to prevent the
uncoloured parts of the copy or profile from being acted upon by light,
have as yet been successful. They have been covered with a coating
of fine varnish, but this has not destroyed their susceptibility of
becoming coloured; and even after repeated washings, sufficient of the
active part of the saline matter will still adhere to the white parts
of the leather or paper, to cause them to become dark when exposed to
the rays of the sun.

"The woody fibres of leaves, and the wings of insects, may be pretty
accurately copied; and in this case it is only necessary to cause the
direct solar light to pass through them, and to receive the shadows
on prepared leather. Images formed by means of the camera obscura
have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect
on nitrate of silver. To copy those images was the first object of
Mr. Wedgwood in his researches on this subject, and for this purpose
he first used the nitrate of silver, which was mentioned to him by a
friend as a substance very sensible to the influence of light; but all
his numerous experiments, as to their primary end, proved unsuccessful."

It will be seen, from the foregoing account of the results of their
experiments, that Mr. Wedgwood's process and the early processes
of Mr. Talbot were nearly alike; and if he had possessed the means
which the compound salt hyposulphite of soda afforded to subsequent
photographers, of destroying the sensibility of the prepared paper to
further impressions of the rays of light, there can be little doubt
that the invention would have attained a high degree of perfection at
the commencement of the present century. As it was, the failure of Mr.
Wedgwood to accomplish the object he was so nearly attaining appears to
have discouraged attempts by others, and twenty years elapsed without
any advance having been made towards its realization.

M. Niepce, of Chalons on the Saone, who was the first to succeed in
obtaining permanent representations of the images of the camera,
commenced experimenting on the subject in 1814, at least ten years
before M. Daguerre directed his attention to Photography. In 1826
these two gentlemen became acquainted, and conjointly prosecuted
the investigations which led to the beautiful result of the
Daguerreotype. M. Niepce having previously succeeded in obtaining
durable representations of the pictures focused in the camera, he
came to this country in 1827, and exhibited several of the results
of his process, and communicated to the Royal Society an account of
his experiments. These photographs, which may be considered the first
durable ones that had been obtained, were, with one exception, taken
on plates made of pewter. One of the largest was 5¼ inches long and 4
inches wide. It was taken from a print 2½ feet in length, representing
the ruins of an abbey. When seen in a proper light, the impression
appeared very distinct. Another one, which was stated to have been the
first successful attempt, was a view taken from nature, representing
a court-yard. Its size was 7½ inches by 6 inches, but it was not so
distinct as the preceding one. A third specimen was an impression on
paper, _printed from a photograph on metal_, the picture having been
etched into the plate by nitric acid, and then printed from. All these
specimens, though extremely curious as the first successful attempts
to preserve the images of the camera, were more or less imperfect,
and were far from presenting the beautiful results of Photography now
attained. It is remarkable, however, that the original process of
etching the picture on a metal plate, and printing from it, has now, in
the perfected state of the art, become the most recent improvement;
and the prints from photographic plates present some of the most
beautiful effects hitherto produced.[2]

M. Niepce communicated the particulars of his process to M. Daguerre
in December, 1829. They then entered into an agreement to pursue their
investigations jointly, but it was not until ten years afterwards that
the invention of the Daguerreotype by M. Daguerre was made known.
To M. Niepce must, therefore, be awarded the honour of having first
discovered the means of rendering permanent the transient images of
the camera obscura. The plan he adopted was to cover a plate of white
metal with asphalte varnish, and expose it to the action of light in
a camera, when the parts whereon the light was concentrated became
hardened, and the other parts remained unaltered, and could be washed
away.

In M. Niepce's account of the process, after describing the preparation
of the asphalte varnish, he says:--"A tablet of _plated silver_, or
well-cleaned and warm _glass_, is to be highly polished, on which a
thin coating of varnish is to be applied cold, with a light roll of
very soft skin. This will impart to it a fine vermilion colour, and
cover it with a very thin and equal coating. The plate is then placed
on heated iron, which is wrapped round with several folds of paper,
from which, by this method, all moisture has been previously expelled.
When the varnish has ceased to simmer, the plate is withdrawn from the
heat and left to cool and dry in a gentle temperature, and protected
from a damp atmosphere. The plate, thus prepared, may be immediately
subjected to the action of the luminous fluid in the focus of the
camera; but even after having been thus exposed a length of time
sufficient for receiving the impressions of external objects, nothing
is apparent to show that these impressions exist. The forms of the
future picture remain still invisible. The next operation then is to
disengage the shrouded image, and this is accomplished by a solvent."

The solvent employed was a mixture of one part of oil of lavender, and
ten parts of oil of petroleum. The solvent was poured over the plate,
and allowed to remain. M. Niepce continues: "The operator, observing
it by reflected light, begins to perceive the images of the objects
to which it has been exposed gradually unfolding their forms, though
still veiled by the supernatant fluid, continually becoming darker from
saturation with the varnish."

The time required for the exposure of the plates in the camera was six
or eight hours. For the purpose of darkening the pictures, M. Niepce
used iodine, and it has been supposed that the use of iodine for that
purpose suggested the employment of it to his partner.

The process adopted by M. Daguerre was, to deposit a film of iodine on
a highly polished silver plate, by exposing the plate to the vapour
of iodine in a dark box. The prepared plate was then placed in the
camera, and after an exposure of ten minutes or more, according to the
brightness of the day, an impression was made on the iodised silver,
but too faint to be visible. To bring out the image thus invisibly
impressed, the plate was exposed to the vapour of mercury, in a closed
box. The mercury adhered to the parts on which the light had acted,
and left the other parts of the plate untouched; and by this means a
beautiful representation was produced, in which the deposited mercury
represented the lights of the picture, and the polished silver the
shadows. The iodised silver remaining on the plate not acted on by
light, was washed away by a solution of hyposulphite of soda, and the
picture could then be exposed without injury.

Nothing can exceed the delicacy of delineation by such a Daguerreotype;
for the fine surface of the highly polished silver seems to exhibit the
impressions of the smallest objects that emit rays of light. The length
of time required to produce an impression was, however, a serious
obstacle to the use of the process, as originally invented, for taking
portraits. Numerous attempts were consequently made to obtain a more
sensitive material. Bromine was tried, in addition to iodine, and with
such complete success, that a few seconds were sufficient to effect an
impression on the plate, which could be forcibly brought out by the
vapour of mercury.

It was in 1840 that portraits were first taken by the Daguerreotype
process in this country. In the first instance, a concave mirror was
employed to concentrate the rays of light on the plate, instead of a
lens; and the author has now in his possession a portrait taken in
this manner, by "Wolcott's reflecting apparatus." The object of using
a concave mirror was to be able to concentrate a greater number of the
rays of light than could be done by a lens, and thus to form a brighter
image. At the time that portrait was taken, the means had not been
discovered of making the mercury adhere to the plate, and a feather
would brush it away. Soon afterwards, however, M. Fizeau ingeniously
contrived to fix the images on the plate by gilding it. This was done
by pouring on to the plate a few drops of a diluted solution of muriate
of gold, and holding it horizontally over the flame of a spirit lamp;
by which means the gold was deposited and formed a thin, beautiful film
of the metal over the surface, and thus not only made the picture more
durable, but gave it increased effect.

The French government, fully appreciating the importance of the
invention, determined to purchase it from the patentee, and to throw it
open to the public. An account of the invention was published in June,
1839; and in the following month an arrangement was entered into, to
the effect that, in consideration of M. Daguerre making the process
fully known, a pension of 6,000 francs should be granted to him for
life, and a pension of 4,000 francs to M. Isidore Niepce, the nephew of
the original inventor of Photography, his uncle having died before the
final success was attained.

It was generally supposed at the time, that by the grant of those
pensions the invention was thrown open to the whole world, as
represented by the French Minister; but, nevertheless, M. Daguerre
patented the process in other countries, and France alone reaped the
benefit of a free use of the invention.

Whilst M. Daguerre was thus successfully working out to perfection the
plan of producing beautiful naturally-impressed pictures on iodised
silver surfaces, Mr. Fox Talbot was at the same time nearly attaining
the same results. The following is the account given by himself of his
researches:[3]--"Having in the year 1834 discovered the principles of
Photography on paper, I some time afterwards made some experiments on
metal plates; and in 1838 I discovered a method of rendering a silver
plate sensitive to light, by exposing it to iodine vapours. I was at
that time, therefore, treading in the footsteps of M. Daguerre, without
knowing that he, or indeed any other person, was pursuing, or had
commenced or thought of, the art which we now call Photography. But
as I was not aware of the power of mercurial vapour to bring out the
latent impressions, I found my plates of iodised silver deficient in
sensibility, and therefore continued to use in preference my photogenic
drawing paper. This was in 1838. Some time after--in August, 1839--M.
Daguerre published an account of his perfected process, which reached
us during the meeting of the British Association; and I took the
opportunity to lay before the Section the facts which I had myself
ascertained in Metallic Photography."

Whilst to M. Daguerre must be awarded the honour of having first
brought to perfection the method of rendering permanent the images of
the camera on metal plates, Mr. Fox Talbot may claim to be the first
who perfected similar images on paper, which the comparative roughness
of the surface alone prevented from being as delicately beautiful
as the pictures of the Daguerreotype. He commenced his experiments
in Photography in 1834; and on the 31st of January, 1839, he read a
paper before the Royal Society, entitled, "Some Account of the Art of
Photogenic Drawing; or, a process by which natural objects may be made
to delineate themselves without the aid of the artist's pencil."

Mr. Talbot had not then succeeded in obtaining the impressions of
images focused in the camera; what he had succeeded in doing was to fix
upon paper the shadows of objects placed upon it, and exposed to the
light of the sun. The paper was first dipped into a solution of common
salt, and then wiped dry, to diffuse the salt uniformly through the
substance of the paper. A solution of nitrate of silver was then spread
over one surface with a soft brush, and dried carefully before a fire
in a darkened room. The strength of the solution was regulated by first
obtaining a saturated solution of the nitrate of silver, and afterwards
diluting it with six or eight times its volume of water. The objects to
be copied, such as leaves, lace, or other flat surfaces, were pressed
against the prepared paper by a glass fixed in a frame, and exposure
to light quickly darkened all the parts of the paper, excepting those
shaded by the objects. The image thus impressed was what is termed a
"negative," the dark parts which excluded the light being left white on
the paper, and the parts through which the light passed being darkened.
To produce a picture corresponding with the natural lights and shades,
the process was repeated, substituting the picture first obtained, on
thin transparent paper, for the original object, by which means the
lights and shadows were reversed.

The chloride of silver, formed on the surface of the sensitive paper
by the combination of the common salt and nitrate of silver, being
insoluble in water, great difficulty was experienced in washing it
away, so as to prevent the whole surface from afterwards darkening
on exposure to light. The application of hyposulphite of soda, for
the purpose of making the pictures durable, was suggested by Sir John
Herschel, and it answers remarkably well, as it dissolves the chloride
of silver. A solution of ammonia is nearly equally efficacious in
removing the chloride.

The Calotype process, by which the images of the camera can be
fixed upon paper, was invented by Mr. Talbot, in 1840. It is thus
described:--Dissolve 100 grains of crystallized nitrate of silver in 6
ounces of distilled water. Procure some fine writing paper, and wash
one side of it with the solution, laid on with a soft brush; then dry
the paper cautiously, by holding it at a distance from the fire. When
dry, dip the paper into a solution of iodide of potassium, containing
500 grains dissolved in 1 pint of water, and let it remain in the
solution two or three minutes. Then dip it into a vessel of water;
remove the water on the surface by blotting paper, and dry it by a
fire, in the dark or by candle-light. The paper thus prepared is called
"iodised paper;" it is not very sensitive to light, and may be kept for
some time without spoiling. Next dissolve 100 grains of crystallized
nitrate of silver in 2 ounces of distilled water; add to the solution
one-sixth of its volume of strong acetic acid, and call that mixture
A. Then make a strong solution of crystallized gallic acid in cold
water, and let that solution be called B. Mix equal volumes of A and
B together in small quantities at a time. That mixture Mr. Talbot
calls gallo-nitrate of silver, and with it wash over the surface of
the iodised paper. Allow the paper to remain half a minute, and then
dip it into water, and again dry it lightly with blotting paper. The
paper thus prepared is very sensitive, and will receive an impression
in the camera in the shortest possible time. The impression is at first
invisible, but it may be brought out by laying the paper aside in the
dark, or by washing it once more in the gallo-nitrate of silver, and
holding it at a short distance from the fire. To fix the picture, the
paper is first washed in water and lightly dried, and then soaked in
a solution of hyposulphite of soda for a few minutes, by which means
the iodised silver is removed, and after being again washed in water
and dried, the process is completed. The picture thus produced is a
negative one, and requires to be transferred in the manner before
stated. The original Calotype may, by that means, serve to produce a
great number of pictures.

Mr. Talbot's patent was sealed on the 8th of February, 1841. In his
specification, he claimed the use of gallic acid, and he succeeded
in enforcing his claim in a Court of Law, though it appeared that on
the 10th of April, 1839, photographs of objects taken in the solar
microscope in five minutes, by the Rev. J. B. Reade, were shown at
the London institution, which were described to have been produced by
an infusion of galls, and fixed with hyposulphite of soda. It must be
mentioned, however, to Mr. Talbot's honour, that on a representation to
him by the President of the Royal Society that the art of Photography
was impeded in its progress in this country by patent monopolies,
he generously made a present to the public of all his inventions
and discoveries, reserving to himself only the privilege of taking
portraits.

The transfer from one paper to another of the picture obtained in
the camera, and the comparative roughness of the surface of the
paper itself, prevent Calotypes from exhibiting that sharpness and
delicacy of definition which are so admirable in a Daguerreotype.
Several attempts were therefore made to obtain a more smooth surface
for the reception of the image; but without much success, until glass
was adopted for the purpose. To make that material available, it is
necessary to coat it with some substance that will absorb the sensitive
solution. In the first instance, the white of eggs was employed
with considerable success. Albumen has, however, been supplanted by
collodion--a solution of gun-cotton in ether--which is found to be
peculiarly suitable for the reception of the sensitive preparation of
silver.

In conducting the collodion process, the collodion is first iodised by
adding to it iodide of potassium and iodide of silver, dissolved in
alcohol. The iodised collodion is then poured over a plate of glass
that has been carefully cleaned, and is moved about horizontally
until a perfectly uniform film is spread over the surface, to which
it adheres firmly. The plate is afterwards dipped into a solution of
nitrate of silver, which renders it so highly sensitive to impressions
of light, that it will receive an image in less than a second. The
image is latent, until it is developed by pouring over the plate a
mixture of pyro-gallic acid in distilled water, acetic acid, and
nitrate of silver. The impression is fixed with hyposulphite of soda.

The pictures produced by the collodion process are negatives, which
serve admirably for transferring positive pictures on to sensitive
paper. But, if required, the negative picture can be readily changed
into a positive one, by converting the darkened silver into white
metallic silver, by a mixture of protosulphate of iron and pyro-gallic
acid. In a short time a white metallic image is obtained, which, when
relieved by a background of black velvet or black varnish, equals in
delicacy of finish the most beautiful Daguerreotypes.

Many attempts have been made, but hitherto without success, to obtain
photographs coloured, as well as shaded, by nature. The opinions of
those who have most studied the subject differ as to the possibility
of ever attaining that desired object. Sir John Herschel has so far
shown that it is not impossible, as to have impressed the colours of
the solar spectrum on paper, by the mere action of light; and parts
of the images of objects fixed on the screen of the camera are also
sometimes coloured. These facts induce us to hope that in the progress
of discovery some means may be found of obtaining naturally-coloured
photographs, notwithstanding it has been pronounced, by good
authorities, to be an absolute impossibility.

Specimens of coloured photographs were exhibited by Mr. Mercer at the
recent meeting of the British Association, which showed that by the
use of various chemical preparations that are sensitive to light,
photographs may be shaded in colours. The principal re-agents employed
were salts of iron, and by immersing the paper in suitable menstrua,
after the image had been impressed in the camera, the picture was
developed in any colour required; the same tint being spread over the
whole. One purpose to which it was suggested this coloured photographic
process is applicable, is printing on woven fabrics, the action of
light serving as a mordant to fix the colours.

Photography has been already applied to various uses, and it is capable
of being rendered much more valuable. To the meteorologist it affords
the means of registering the rise and fall of the mercury in the
barometer and thermometer, and, by a self-registering apparatus, the
changes of temperature and of atmospheric pressure are marked upon
paper that records the time at which the changes occur. It may also be
applied, in the same manner, to register the directions of the wind,
and the times of its changes. The sun impresses his own image upon
paper; and the spots on his surface, thus correctly delineated, can be
compared with those seen in pictures of the sun at other times; and
the foundation is laid for more correct knowledge of the nature of
those appearances, and of the motion of the sun himself. Photographs of
the moon and planets present exact representations of those heavenly
bodies, as seen through the most powerful telescope; and, with the
assistance of the stereoscope, the figure of the moon is shown in its
true globular form, as it can be seen by no other means. It has been
proposed, indeed, by the aid of Photography, to extend our knowledge
of the stars far beyond the reach of telescopic vision; for as the
image focused on the screen of the camera is composed of rays from
every object on the body of a star, it might be possible to see those
objects by greatly magnifying the image. It remains, however, for the
further progress of discovery and invention, to arrive at so delicate a
delineation by photographic processes, as to obtain landscapes of the
moon, and portraits of the inhabitants of Jupiter!

One of the latest advances in the art of Photography has been the
engraving on steel-plates by the action of light, by which means more
forcible effects have been obtained than by the impressions of light
upon paper. Mr. Fox Talbot has distinguished himself in thus fixing the
images on steel, as he was the first to impress them upon paper. In
his method of doing so, he covers the steel plate with a solution of
isinglass and bichromate of potass, and placing a collodion negative
picture upon it, he exposes it to the action of light. When the picture
is sufficiently impressed, he etches it into the plate by means of
bichloride of platinum. M. Niepce, the nephew of the original inventor
of Photography, has produced the same effect by reviving the first
processes adopted by his uncle; using, as he did, bitumen, dissolved
in essential oil of lavender, to cover the plates. Two other foreign
photographers, M. Poitevin and M. Pretschi, have also successfully
directed their attention to engraving the images of the camera, which
has now obtained a high degree of perfection.

It is well worth notice that these most recent improvements in
Photography are but further developments of the original designs of M.
Niepce, who not only succeeded in etching the pictures impressed by the
light of the sun on his metal tablets, but made use of a glass surface,
on which the now generally adopted collodion process depends.




DISSOLVING VIEWS.


There are no optical illusions more extraordinary than those shown
in the exhibition of Dissolving Views. The effects of the changes in
the diorama are only such as are seen in nature, the same scene being
represented under different circumstances, and the marvel in that case
is that such beautiful and natural effects can be produced on the
same canvas. But Dissolving Views set nature at defiance, and exhibit
metamorphoses as great as can be conceived by the wildest fancy.

Whilst, for instance, the spectator is looking at the interior of a
church, he sees the objects gradually assuming different appearances.
The columns that support the vaulted roof begin to fade away, and their
places are occupied by other forms, which gradually become better
defined and stronger, and a tree, a house, or, it may be, a rock,
thrusts the columns out of view, and the roof dims into blue sky,
chequered with clouds. The original view thus entirely disappears, and
the scene is changed from the interior of a church to open country, or
to a rocky valley. This is done, not by changing at once one scene
into another, but by substituting different individual objects, which
at first appear like faint shadows, and then, becoming more and more
vivid, at length altogether supplant their predecessors on the field of
view, and will, in their turn, be extinguished by others.

It sometimes happens that some strongly marked object resists
apparently the efforts made to dispossess it, and in the midst of a
mountainous scene will be observed the form of a chandelier or of a
statue, that occupied a distinguished place in the church that has
just vanished. In a short time, however, these relics disappear, and
the mountain, the valley, and the lake are freed from the incongruous
images of the former scene.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

These effects are produced in a manner as simple as they are
extraordinary. All that is requisite is to have two magic lanterns
fitted on to a stand, with their tubes inclined towards each other, so
that both discs of light may exactly coincide, and form on the screen
a single disc. If paintings on glass, representing different views, be
then placed in each lantern, with the lenses adjusted to bring the rays
to a focus on the screen, the two images will be so mingled together
as to present only a confused mixture of colours. Suppose one of the
views to be the interior of a church, and the other to be a mountain
scene;--the pillars of the church will be mingled with trees and rocks,
and in the midst of the confusion there may perhaps be discerned
a strongly painted chandelier or an altar piece. When an opaque
shade is placed before the lens of either of the lanterns, to prevent
the light from reaching the screen, the previous confusion becomes
instantly clear and distinct, and the church or the landscape is seen
without any interfering images. If the opaque screen be gradually
withdrawn from one lens, and at the same time drawn in an equal degree
over the other, the different objects will again be mingled, and those
in the one scene will predominate over those in the other in proportion
to the relative quantities of light permitted to issue from each
lantern to the screen. The two first of the accompanying drawings are
thus blended together in the third, when the screen is half withdrawn
from each.

[Illustration]

It is usual to fix the opaque shade, which alternately covers and
exposes the two magic lanterns, on to a central pin, so that it may be
moved vertically up or down. The shade is so arranged, that in raising
the end to cover the lens of one lantern, the farther end descends,
and exposes, in an equal degree, the other lens. During the time that
either of the views is altogether concealed, the painting is changed;
and in this manner an unlimited number of metamorphoses may be effected.

It requires no expensive apparatus to show the effect of Dissolving
Views on a small scale. Two common magic lanterns are quite sufficient
for the purpose of private exhibition, and the angle at which they
should be fixed on their stand may be readily ascertained after a few
trials. To make the transformation more extraordinary, a man's face may
be painted on one glass and a landscape on the other; and, when the
change is made from the face to the landscape, a strongly painted eye
or nose may be seen occupying the centre of the view, long after the
other features have disappeared, until all the rays of light from that
painting have been excluded. The change from youth to age, from beauty
to ugliness, may also be shown with striking effect.

It will be observed that the principle, on which the metamorphoses
of Dissolving Views depend, is similar to that which produces the
variations in the diorama. In both cases there are two paintings on
the same space, either of which may be shown at pleasure by different
dispositions of the light; the chief difference between them being
that the Dissolving Views are seen altogether by reflected light,
whilst in the diorama the paintings at the back and front are shown
alternately by reflected and by transmitted light.




THE KALEIDOSCOPE.


No invention, on being first brought out, created so general a
sensation as the Kaleidoscope. Every person, who could buy or make one,
had a Kaleidoscope. Men, women, and children--rich and poor; in houses
or walking in the streets; in carriages, or on coaches--were to be seen
looking into the wonder-working tube, admiring the beautiful patterns
it produced, and the magical changes which the least movement of the
glass occasioned.

It was in the year 1814 that Sir David Brewster discovered the
principle on which the effects of the Kaleidoscope depend, whilst
he was engaged in experiments on the polarization of light by
successive reflections between plates of glass. The reflectors were
in some cases inclined to each other, and he remarked the circular
arrangement of the images of a candle round a centre. In afterwards
repeating the experiments of M. Biot on the action of fluids on
light, he placed the fluids in a trough formed by two plates of glass
cemented together at an angle. The eye being placed at one end, some
of the cement which pressed through between the plates appeared to be
arranged in a circular figure. The symmetry of this figure being very
remarkable, Sir David Brewster undertook to investigate the cause of
the phenomenon, and the result of his investigations was the invention
of the instrument to which he gave the name of Kaleidoscope, from the
Greek words καλος {kalos}, beautiful, ειδος {eidos}, a form, and σκοπεω
{skopeô}, to see.[4]

The Kaleidoscope in its simplest form consists of two equal strips of
plate glass, about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide, silvered on one
side, to act as reflectors. These glasses are placed one over the other
exactly, and then the edges on one side being separated, whilst the
two other edges are kept close together, they are fixed by means of
separating pieces of wood and string at the angle required. The glasses
are then fitted into a metal tube, which has an eye-hole at one end,
and at the other end of the tube there is fixed a small cell of ground
glass, to contain pieces of differently stained glass or other objects,
that are to be multiplied by reflections into beautiful symmetrical
figures. In the better kind of Kaleidoscopes, the cell containing the
objects may be turned round, by which means the pieces of glass shift
their positions, and the figures instantly change. The same effect is
produced, though in a less agreeable manner, in the common kind of
instruments, by turning the tube.

To form by the combined reflections from the two glasses a perfectly
symmetrical figure, the sector comprised between the inclined sides of
the glasses may consist of any even aliquot part of a circle. In the
accompanying diagram, the ends of the flat silvered glasses _a c_, _b
c_, are inclined at an angle of 60 degrees; therefore the circle is
completed by the junction of six sectors. In such a Kaleidoscope, the
circular figure will be formed by three reflections from each glass.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

To make the formation of the circular figure by repeated reflections
more intelligible, we will consider it as composed of the smallest
possible number of equal divisions, as in the second diagram, in which
the circle is divided into quadrants. In such an arrangement of the
reflectors, the figure seen on looking through the central aperture
will consist of four parts. In the first place, the objects included in
the space _a b c_, between the inclined glasses, will be seen directly
by rays of light from the objects themselves; viz., the small cross
_d_, and the triangle _e_. The same field of view will be reflected
from both mirrors, by which reflection the cross on one side will
seem to be doubled, and the triangle on the other will have another
similar one added to it, to make a complete rhomb. The cross will also
be reflected by the mirror on the right side, and the triangle by the
one on the left. The images of the objects contained within the space
_a b c_, being thus presented by reflection on both sides, they become
the objects for further reflections from parts of the mirrors still
nearer the spectator. Thus the images _d_¹ on both sides are reflected
to form the single image _d_², and the images _e_¹ are in the same
manner reflected to form the second image _e_².

When the angle formed by the inclination of the mirrors divides the
circle into a greater number of sectors, the reflections of the images
are repeated, from points nearer and nearer to the eye, and the circle
is thus completed, however numerous the sectors may be; but at each
repetition of the reflection, the images will become more dim, since,
owing to the imperfection of reflecting surfaces, a portion of the
light is absorbed at each reflection.

In the first instruments that were constructed, the objects were
fixed in the field of view, therefore scarcely any change of pattern
was obtainable. It was not until some time afterwards that the idea
occurred to Sir David Brewster of producing endless changes of the
figures, by making the objects movable in a cell of glass at the end
of the instrument. He afterwards introduced other improvements in the
Kaleidoscope, for extending its range of objects, for varying the
angles of inclination, and for projecting the figures on a screen. In
the instrument, as ordinarily made, the objects to be seen properly
must be placed close to the end of the reflectors; but by the addition
to the instrument of a tube containing a lens, the rays from distant
objects are brought to a focus near the mirrors, and the image formed
there is repeated by the reflectors in the same manner as a solid
object.

The projection of the figures on a screen, by an apparatus similar to
a magic lantern, gives great additional pleasure to the effects of
the Kaleidoscope, as the figures are not only seen by several persons
at the same time, but they are presented in a magnified form. The
projection of the figures also increases the use of the instrument in
designing patterns, for which purpose it has been employed with great
advantage.

A patent for the Kaleidoscope was taken out in 1817, but the high
prices charged by the opticians who were authorized by the inventor
to sell the instrument, and the facility with which it could be
made, occasioned a general violation of the patent right, and it was
not long before the claim of Sir David Brewster, as the original
inventor, was disputed. In the indignant vindication of his claim, he
observes:--"There never was a popular invention which the labours of
envious individuals did not attempt to trace to some remote period;"
and the Kaleidoscope was not an exception. It was found that Kircher
had described the effects of repeated reflections as far back as
1630; and that Mr. Bradley had, in 1717, made a philosophical toy,
consisting of two small mirrors, that opened like a book, which, when
partially opened, repeated the reflections of objects placed near it
in the same manner as the Kaleidoscope. But this instrument was so
different in its construction, and in the effects it produced, from the
Kaleidoscope, that Sir David Brewster's claim to be the inventor may
be freely admitted. The fact that it took the world by surprise, and
created a sensation greater than any other invention had done before,
is sufficient to establish its title as an original invention.




THE MAGIC DISC.


There are several ways of illustrating the retention by the retina of
the eye of the images of objects after they have been withdrawn from
sight, but none is so curious as the philosophical toy called the Magic
Disc, which, from the optical principles involved in its extraordinary
effects, deserves to be noticed as one of the remarkable inventions of
the present century.

One of the most striking methods of exhibiting the retentive property
of the retina, before the invention of the Magic Disc, was to paint
different objects at the back and on the front of a card, and by then
giving rapid rotation to the card, both objects were seen together.
Thus, when the figure of a bird is painted on one side, and an empty
cage on the other, by rapidly turning the card, the bird appears to be
in the cage. In the Magic Disc the objects are painted on the same side
of a circular piece of card-board, and both are exposed to view during
their rapid rotation.

The disc is divided into eight or ten compartments, in each one of
which the same figures are repeated, though the positions of one
or more of them are changed. A favourite subject represented is a
clown leaping over the back of a pantaloon, which affords a simple
illustration of the apparent relative movements of two bodies, and will
serve to explain how the effect is produced.

[Illustration]

The instrument consists of a disc of stiff card-board, about nine
inches diameter, mounted on a horizontal pivot in the centre, on which
it may be freely turned. Between each of the compartments of the disc
there is an elongated aperture, about one inch long and a quarter of an
inch wide, for the eye to look through. Suppose the disc to be divided
into eight compartments, by radial lines. In the compartment No. 1,
the pantaloon is represented in a stooping posture, and the clown is
on the ground ready to make a spring. In No. 2 the pantaloon is in the
same attitude, but the clown has commenced his leap, and is raised a
little way from the ground. In the third division he is shown still
higher in the air; and in the fourth he is mounted above the shoulders
of pantaloon, who retains the same posture as at first. The fifth
compartment represents the clown as having jumped over pantaloon's
head, and coming down to the ground; and in each succeeding division
his farther descent is shown, till, in No. 8, he has reached the ground
again, and is ready to recommence the leap.

When the disc is turned rapidly round on its pivot, the figures
painted upon it are mingled together, and present a confused medley of
lines and colours, in which no object can be distinctly defined. This
mingling of the objects is caused by the retention of the images by the
retina, so that if the eye be directed to any point, the impression of
the lines and colours that pass rapidly before it is not effaced before
another and another appear to produce fresh impressions, and they
mingle together in confusion. If, for instance, there were a circle
formed of dots marked on the disc, the impression of each dot on the
retina would be prolonged; and as, by the rotation, other dots would
come into the field of view before the impression of the first was
removed, it would form an unbroken ring. But if the disc were screened
from sight, at intervals of nearly equal duration to that of the
continuous impression, so as to efface the image of one dot before the
rays of another were admitted to the eye, then the ring would be seen
to be composed of dots, as distinctly as when the disc was stationary.

The effect of screening the objects from the eye at short intervals
is produced by looking with one eye through the openings at the image
of the disc, reflected from a mirror. The figures are then seen only
when the apertures come opposite the eye; but as the impression of one
view remains till it is renewed by the light admitted through the next
aperture, there is continuous vision of the objects painted on the disc.

It is thus that the figures of pantaloon and clown become visible, and
their apparent relative movements are occasioned. For instance; each
time that the impression of the figure of the pantaloon is renewed,
he is seen in the same place and in the same attitude; therefore he
appears to be stationary, though the successive pictures that compose
his figure to the eye are in rapid rotary motion. The figure of the
clown, however, is seen in a different position each time that he
comes into view, therefore he appears to be in motion relatively to
pantaloon, though stationary as regards his absolute position on the
disc.

The same effect would be produced if the disc, during its rotation,
were seen by successive electric sparks. The electric spark is so
momentary in its duration, that the most rapidly moving objects appear
stationary; therefore each spark would show a seemingly stationary
disc, on which the figure of the clown would appear in different
relative positions; and the illusion would be as perfect as when the
rays of light are interrupted at intervals.

The electric spark is so instantaneous that a cannon ball might be
seen in its rapid flight, if illuminated by a flash of lightning, and
would seem to be stationary. Professor Faraday mentioned, in one of his
lectures, the extraordinary appearance which a man, who was jumping
over a stile, presented when seen by lightning on a dark night. The man
seemed to be resting horizontally in the air, with one hand touching
the stile.

The duration of the impression of an object on the retina is capable of
illustration by means of the Magic Disc in a great variety of designs,
each one of which may represent many movements. The turning of the
wheels of machinery, the tossing of balls, the dancing figures of men
and women may thus be shown, the designs for which afford ample scope
for exercising the pencil of an ingenious artist.




THE DIORAMA.


Those who are old enough to remember the Regent's Park before there
were any houses northward of the New Road, may recollect that among
the first buildings erected, on what is now called Park Square, was a
strange-looking, partly semi-circular erection, provided with ample
lighting space, which attracted great attention during its progress,
and was the cause of much speculation as to its probable purpose. That
building was intended for the exhibition of the Diorama.

M. Daguerre, the inventor of the Daguerreotype, had, in conjunction
with M. Bouton, a short time previously opened a similar exhibition in
Paris, where the beauty of the paintings, aided by the extraordinary
effects of newly contrived dispositions of the light, had excited
a great sensation. The Diorama was opened in London on the 6th of
October, 1823, and for a long time it was equally popular in this
metropolis.

The visitors, after passing through a gloomy anteroom, were ushered
into a circular chamber, apparently quite dark. One or two small
shrouded lamps placed on the floor served dimly to light the way
to a few descending steps, and the voice of an invisible guide gave
directions to walk forward. The eye soon became sufficiently accustomed
to the darkness to distinguish the objects around, and to perceive
that there were several persons seated on benches opposite an open
space, resembling a large window. Through the window was seen the
interior of a cathedral, undergoing partial repair, with the figures
of two or three workmen resting from their labour. The pillars, the
arches, the stone floor and steps, stained with damp, and the planks
of wood strewn on the ground, all seemed to stand out in bold relief,
so solidly as not to admit a doubt of their substantiality, whilst the
floor extended to the distant pillars, temptingly inviting the tread
of exploring footsteps. Few could be persuaded that what they saw was
a mere painting on a flat surface. This impression was strengthened
by perceiving the light and shadows change, as if clouds were passing
over the sun, the rays of which occasionally shone through the
painted windows, casting coloured shadows on the floor. Then shortly
the brightness would disappear, and the former gloom again obscure
the objects that had been momentarily illuminated. The illusion was
rendered more perfect by the excellence of the painting, and by the
sensitive condition of the eye in the darkness of the surrounding
chamber. Whilst gazing in wrapt admiration at the architectural
beauties of the cathedral, the spectator's attention was disturbed by
sounds underground. He became conscious that the scene before him was
slowly moving away, and he obtained a glimpse of another and very
different prospect, which gradually advanced until it was completely
developed, and the cathedral had disappeared. What he now saw was a
valley, surrounded by high mountains capped with snow. This mountain
valley seemed scarcely less real than the arched roof and columns of
the cathedral, whilst a foaming cascade, dashing down the rocks, and
the sound of rushing waters, added to the illusion. After looking for
some time at this beautiful valley, the clouds were seen to gather on
the mountain tops, and a storm impended. A gleam of sun-light, still
resting on the edge of the clouds, exhibited a strange contrast between
the silvery brightness and the dense black vapour that shrouded the
hills, and could almost be felt. It was but a passing thunderstorm.
Presently the dark clouds rose from the valley, and dispersed; the sun
again shone on cottage, vineyard, and mountain, charming the spectator
as much by the beauty of the scene as he was astonished by the
wonderful change.

Such was the Diorama as it was first exhibited in London to admiring
crowds. In subsequent years greater changes were made in the variations
of light and shade; and by the introduction of mechanical contrivances,
with more or less success, the magical effects were increased, without,
however, adding to the apparent reality of the objects. A church or
cathedral was always the subject of one view, and sometimes of both.
The interior of an empty church would be shown by evening twilight.
The shades of evening gradually darkened into the obscurity of
night, and then the glimmer of candles would be seen spreading more
and more widely, until the church was lighted up, and it was occupied
by a crowded congregation at midnight mass. Some views represented
the exterior of a ruin or of a cathedral after sunset, and as night
advanced, the stars twinkled in the blue sky, and the moon rose and
threw its silvery light on water, buildings, and clouds, contrasting
in some cases with the red glare of lamps from the windows of houses
and shops. The disc of the moon exactly resembled that of the real
luminary, and all around being so dark, the rays from its surface cast
shadows of intervening objects. In one picture a still more astonishing
appearance was produced, by the change of the interior of a beautifully
painted and decorated church into a mass of charred ruins.

The means principally adopted for the production of these magical
changes in a painting on a flat surface, and for giving such seeming
reality to the objects represented, were for some time kept secret;
nor do we think they are even yet much known. As in many other clever
inventions, the effects are produced in a very simple manner. The
picture is painted on both sides of a transparent screen, and the
change of scene is occasioned almost entirely by exhibiting the picture
at one time by reflected light, from the surface nearest the spectator,
and afterwards by transmitted light, after excluding the light from the
front.

Let us take for illustration the interior of a church, at first seen
empty, and afterwards filled with people, and illuminated by candles.
The empty church is painted on the front on fine canvas or silk, in
transparent colours, and at the back are the figures and candles,
and other objects intended to appear with them. The arrangements for
illuminating the picture are so contrived, that the light may be thrown
entirely on the front or on the back, or partly on both. When the light
is on the front, the empty church only is visible. It is then gradually
darkened, and the back of the picture is illuminated, by which means
the figures and candles are seen; and the form of the building being
preserved, the same church, which was before empty, becomes occupied by
a crowded congregation.

It may be mentioned, as an illustration of the perfect illusion of
the Diorama, that a lady who on one occasion accompanied the author
to the exhibition, was so fully convinced that the church represented
was real, that she asked to be conducted down the steps to walk in the
building.

[Illustration]

The effect of changing the direction of the light may be readily
perceived by making a drawing on both sides of a sheet of paper, as
shown in the annexed engraving. The side backing this page represents
the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral when empty, and on the back
several figures are drawn. Those figures are invisible until the
leaf is held up against the light, and when the drawing is seen as a
transparency, the objects on the back, as well as those in front, come
into view, and the building appears to be occupied.

[Illustration]

Any one who has a taste for drawing, and a little ingenuity, may thus
produce many pleasing and astonishing effects. It will be desirable
to procure, in the first instance, a box, so contrived that it will
hold the painting, and afford the means of throwing the light on the
front or on the back at pleasure. The diagram shows the form of such
a box. The letters _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ mark the outside; the aperture,
at _c d_, being enlarged to permit several persons to look into it at
the same time. The box may be of any required dimensions, to suit the
size of the drawing, which is to be fitted into a groove at _a b_,
and the interior must be blackened. The lid, _e_, when open, as in
the diagram, admits the light to the front of the picture, the back
being covered with an opaque screen. As the lid is closed, the picture
becomes darkened, and by the gradual removal of the screen at the same
time, it is changed into a transparency. This portable Diorama can be
most conveniently shown by lamplight, the flame of an argand lamp, the
wick of which can be heightened and lowered, being best adapted for
the purpose. The effect by daylight is, however, superior, but the
room must then be darkened, and the admission of light confined to the
picture.

[Illustration]

The moving water, and the motion of smoke and clouds, which were
frequently introduced in the Diorama, were mechanical additions, the
effects being produced by giving motion to bodies behind, the forms
of which were seen by transmitted light. The introduction of such
mechanical aids, however, detract from the artistic character of the
Diorama, the principal merit of which consists in exhibiting the
changes occasioned by variations in the mode of throwing the light on
the two-faced picture.

It is to be regretted that exhibitions of a larger and more showy kind
should have superseded the Diorama in public estimation; and that,
from the want of support, their charming and marvellous pictorial
representations, which formed, in days gone by, one of the principal
"sights" of London, should be now closed.




THE STEREOSCOPE.


One of the most beautiful as well as the most remarkable pictorial
illusions is produced by the combination of two views into one by the
recently invented instrument called the Stereoscope. In the Diorama, in
the Magic Disc, and in the Dissolving Views, separate paintings combine
to produce different effects; but in the Stereoscope the two pictures
unite into one to give additional effect to the same view, and to make
that which is a flat surface, when seen singly, appear to project like
a solid body.

The principle of the Stereoscope depends on the different appearance
which near objects present when seen by the right or by the left eye.
For instance, on looking at a book placed edgewise, with the right eye,
the back and one side of the book will be perceived; and on closing
the right eye and opening the left, the back and the other side of the
book will be seen, and the right-hand side will be invisible. It is the
combination of both these views by vision with two eyes that produces
the impression of solidity of objects on the mind; and if the different
appearances which the book presents to each eye be copied in separate
drawings, and they can afterwards be placed in such a position as to
form a united image on the retinæ of the eyes, the same effect is
produced as if the book itself were looked upon.

[Illustration]

This diagram represents the outlines of a near object, as seen by each
eye separately. The one on the right hand shows it as seen with the
right eye, and the other as it looks with the left eye; and if both
drawings be combined into one image, it stands out in bold relief.
This may be done without any instrument, by squinting at them; but
the effect is more readily and far more agreeably produced by the
Stereoscope, so named from the Greek words στερος {steros}, solid, and
σκοπεω {skopeô}, to see.

Professor Wheatstone claims to be the first who contrived an instrument
to illustrate this effect of binocular vision, and he also claims to be
the first who brought to notice the different appearances of objects
seen with each eye separately. Sir David Brewster, however, disputes,
on behalf of Mr. Elliot, of Edinburgh, Professor Wheatstone's claim to
the invention of the first stereoscopic instrument; and he has shown
that the difference of vision with each eye was remarked by Galen,
1,700 years ago; that it was noticed by Leonardo da Vinci in 1500, and
formed the subject of a treatise by a Jesuit, named Francis Aquilonius,
in 1613; and that it was a well-known phenomenon of vision long before
it was mentioned by Professor Wheatstone.[5] Mr. Elliot, though he
conceived the idea, in 1834, of constructing an instrument for uniting
two dissimilar pictures, did not carry it into effect until 1839, the
year after Mr. Wheatstone had exhibited his reflecting Stereoscope to
the Royal Society, and at the meeting of the British Association.

Mr. Elliot's contrivance, to which Sir David Brewster is inclined to
give precedence in point of date, was very inferior in its effects
to the reflecting Stereoscope. It was without lenses or mirrors, and
consisted of a wooden box 18 inches long, 7 inches broad, and 4½ deep,
and at the end of it was placed the dissimilar pictures, as seen by
each eye, that were to be united into one. The view he drew for the
purpose comprised the moon, a cross, and the stump of a tree, at
different distances; and when looked at in the box, the cross and the
stump of the tree appeared to stand out in relief.

The accompanying woodcut represents the original stereoscopic pictures,
copied from Sir David Brewster's book; and by looking towards the
picture on the left with the right eye, and on the right-hand picture
with the left eye, the two will be seen united, and the cross and the
stump of the tree will appear to stand out solidly.

The arrangement of the apparatus, as described by Professor Wheatstone,
in his paper read before the Royal Society, consists of two plane
mirrors, about 4 inches square, placed at right angles; and the
drawings, made on separate pieces of paper, were reflected to the eyes
looking into the mirrors at their junction. The diagram is a sketch of
this arrangement. In the middle of a narrow slip of wood, _d e_, about
12 inches long, the two mirrors, _a b_, are fixed, inclined at the
required angle from their line of junction at _c_. Upright pieces of
wood, _d h_, _e f_, at each end, are furnished with slides or clips to
hold the drawings, which are reflected from the inclined mirrors, and
seen in them by each eye separately. Thus, the left eye sees only the
picture fixed on _d h_, and the right eye sees the one placed at _e f_;
and the two images, being combined at the seat of vision, produce the
same impression as a solid body.

It is almost unnecessary to describe the external appearance of the
lenticular instrument invented by Sir David Brewster, and explained by
him at the meeting of the British Association in 1849. In the best kind
of instruments the glasses, through which the pictures are seen, are
composed of a single large double-convex lens, divided in the middle,
the thin edges being set towards each other, about 2½ inches apart. The
more improved instruments, indeed, are made from lenses upwards of 3
inches in diameter, which, being cut into two, and the thin parts being
ground flat, are set edge to edge, and from an aperture sufficiently
large for both eyes to look through. By this means the instrument
suits all eyes, without requiring adjustment, and the field of view is
increased. A diaphragm, or partition, placed at the junction of the two
lenses, confines the vision of each eye to its appropriated picture,
and thus tends to prevent the confusion of images that might otherwise
arise.

The object of using semi-lenses is to facilitate the union of the two
pictures into one, by looking through the lens towards its edge,
instead of through the centre, the image being thus refracted to a
different position. This may be easily exemplified by looking at an
object steadily through different parts of the same lens. After looking
at it with the right eye through the centre, and whilst keeping the
axis of the eye in the same direction, move the lens slowly towards the
right, so as to bring the edge of the lens opposite the pupil. This
movement of the lens towards the right hand will be accompanied by an
apparent movement of the image towards the left, so as to bring it to a
point between the two eyes. If the experiment be repeated with the left
eye, the image will be removed towards the right hand; and thus, by
looking at the two stereoscopic pictures through the thin parts of two
lenses, the images are superposed and form a single one.

Sir David Brewster attached much importance to the semi-lenses, which
have the effect of prisms in refracting the rays of light; but that
form of lens is not essential to give apparent solidity to the images;
and many of the commoner kind of instruments are now made with ordinary
double-convex lenses, and without any partition. With the semi-lens,
however, there is less difficulty in uniting the two pictures into one
than when an ordinary lens is employed.

In taking photographic pictures for the Stereoscope with a single
camera, it is necessary to alter the angle of the instrument after
having taken one picture, to direct it to the same object in the
angle of vision as seen by the other eye. This method of producing
stereoscopic pictures with the same camera is very objectionable when
any moving objects are in the field; for they will be in a different
position in each, and sometimes disappear altogether from the second
picture. The plan adopted by the best photographers is to have two
cameras set at the requisite angle to each other, so that both pictures
or portraits may be taken at the same time.

At the meeting of the British Association in 1853, M. Claudet
endeavoured to establish some rules for the angle at which photographic
pictures must be taken, in order to produce the best effect of relief
and distance without exaggeration. He observed, that in looking at a
single picture with two eyes, there is less relief and less distance
than when looking at it with one eye, because in the latter case we
have the same effect we are accustomed to feel when we look at the
natural objects with one eye; while, if we look at the single picture
with two eyes, we have on the two retinæ the same image with the same
perspective, which is not natural, and the eyes have not to make the
usual effort for altering their convergence according to the plane on
which the object observed is situated. This inaction of the convergence
of the eyes diminishes the illusion of the picture, because the same
convergence for all the objects represented gives an idea that they
are all placed on the same plane. The photographic image being the
representation of two different perspectives, we must, when we look
at them in the Stereoscope, as when looking at the natural objects
themselves, converge, more or less, the axes of the eyes. Therefore
we make the same effort, and have the same sensation in regarding
the combined photographic pictures, as when we look at the objects
represented.

Sir David Brewster has suggested various applications of the
Stereoscope; viz., to painting, to sculpture and engineering, to
natural history, to education, and to purposes of amusement. The latter
is the principal purpose to which the instrument is at present applied;
and some of the many ways in which it may contribute to delight the
spectator are pointed out in Sir David Brewster's book.

"For the purpose of amusement," he observes, "the photographer might
carry us even into the regions of the supernatural. His art enables
him to give a spiritual appearance to one or more of his figures,
and to exhibit them as 'thin air,' amid the solid realities of the
stereoscopic picture. While a party are engaged with their whist or
their gossip, a female figure appears in the midst of them with all the
attributes of the supernatural. Her form is transparent; every object
or person beyond her being seen in shadowy but distinct outline. She
may occupy more than one place in the scene, and different portions
of the group might be made to gaze upon one or other of the visions
before them. In order to produce such a scene, the parties which are
to compose the group must have their portraits nearly finished in the
binocular camera, in the attitude which they may be supposed to assume
if the vision were real. When the party have nearly sat the proper
length of time, the female figure, suitably attired, walks quickly to
the place assigned to her, and after standing a few seconds in the
proper attitude, retires quickly, or takes as quickly a second, or even
a third, place in the picture, if it is required, in each of which she
remains a few seconds, so that her picture in these different positions
may be taken with sufficient distinctness in the negative photograph.
If these operations have been well performed, all the objects
immediately behind the female figure, having been previous to her
introduction impressed upon the negative surface, will be seen through
her, and she will have the appearance of an aërial personage, unlike
the other figures in the picture."

It is in the foregoing manner that the remarkable stereoscopic effect
of "Sir David Brewster's ghost" is produced, a representation of which
is given in the next page.

Sir David Brewster mentions many other curious applications of the
Stereoscope, among which are the dioramic effects of pictures seen
alternately by reflected and by transmitted light; a daylight view
being apparently lighted up artificially in the night, by seeing it at
one time with the light reflected from the surface, and then excluding
the light from the front, and viewing it as a transparency.

One of the most interesting effects of the Stereoscope has been
recently produced by Mr. De la Rue, who has contrived the means of
giving apparent rotundity to the surface of the moon, as viewed
through a powerful telescope. The disc of the full moon, however
highly magnified, presents, as is well-known, the appearance of a flat
surface, with the lights and shadows marked seemingly on a plane.
Owing to the great distance of that luminary, there is no variation
in its appearance, whether it be looked at with one eye or with the
other, therefore it seems removed beyond the operation of the ordinary
cause of stereoscopic effects. Nevertheless, Mr. De la Rue has taken
photographs of the moon which, when placed in the Stereoscope, combine
to form a solid-looking globe, on which all the lights and shadows are
distinctly and beautifully delineated. He has produced this effect by
taking his photographs at different periods of the year, when there is
a slight variation in the direction of the moon's face to the earth;
and by combining these separate photographs into one image in the
Stereoscope, the form of the moon appears as convex as the surface of
an artificial globe.

M. Claudet, who is one of the most successful photographers in
the metropolis, has contrived an arrangement which he calls a
"Stereomonoscope," by which the appearance of solidity is communicated
to a single image formed on a screen of ground glass. The screen of
ground glass has a black back, and is placed in the focus of a lens in
an ordinary camera obscura, wherein the image may be seen by looking
down upon it. The particles of the roughened glass reflect to each
eye different parts of the image focused on the screen, and by this
means a similar effect is produced as when two dissimilar pictures are
looked at through a stereoscope instrument. One great advantage of this
arrangement is that several persons may look at the image at the same
time.

Mr. John Sang, of Kirkaldy, has very recently imparted stereoscopic
effect to copies of paintings and engravings, the flat surfaces of
which were previously thought to defy any such application of the
Stereoscope. The means he employs of doing so are at present kept
secret, but he has shown its practicability by copying, on wood
engravings, Mr. George Cruikshank's series of "The Bottle." In some
respects this process seems almost more wonderful than the original
Stereoscope, for it gives solid form and apparent substantiality to the
mere creations of the artist's pencil.




THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.


No application of science has so completely realized the visions of
fancy as the Electric Telegraph. So closely, indeed, does the real of
the present day approach to the ideal of ages past, that it might be
supposed the narratives in the tales of faëry land were true records
of the inventions of former times, and that the combined efforts of
inventive genius during the last half century were but imitations and
reproductions of what had been successfully accomplished "once upon a
time." There is also an intermediate period--between the indefinite
of faëry tales and the positive of scientific history--in which
sympathetic tablets and magical loadstones, scarcely less mythical, are
stated to have been invented; and the individuals are named who thus
paved the way for instantaneous communication between all parts of the
world.

The Jesuits of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries took the
place of the magicians of the Middle Ages. In the seclusion of their
monasteries, they speculated on the mysterious powers of Nature, then
partially revealed to them, and shadowed forth images of their possible
applications. It is to a vague speculation of this kind that we may
attribute the notice given by Strada, in his "Prolusiones Academicæ,"
of the sympathetic magnetic needles, by which two friends at a distance
were able to communicate; though the then fanciful idea has been
literally realized. A still more extraordinary foreshadowing of one
of the most recent improvements of the Electric Telegraph was the
transference of written letters from one place to another by electric
agency. This is said to have been accomplished by Kircher, who, in his
"Prolusiones Magneticæ," describes, though very vaguely, the mode of
operation. But even admitting that there were substantial foundations
for these imaginary phantasms, that would not in the least detract from
the merit of those who, following closely the footsteps of scientific
discovery, have successfully applied the principles unfolded by the
investigations of others, and by their own assiduous researches. Thus,
whilst steam navigation was facilitating the means of intercourse over
rivers and seas, and whilst railways and locomotive engines served to
bring distant cities within a few hours' journey of each other, another
source of power, infinitely more rapid in its action than steam, has
been made to transmit intelligence from place to place, and from one
country to another, with the speed of lightning.

The plan of making communications by signals has been in operation from
time immemorial; the beacon lights on hills having served in ancient
as well as in modern times to give warning of danger, or to announce
tidings of joy. Such simple signals were not capable of much variety of
expression; but even beacon lights might be made to indicate different
kinds of intelligence, by multiplying the number of the fires, and
by altering their relative positions. It was not, however, till the
invention of telegraphs that anything approaching to the means of
holding regular communication by signals was attained. The semaphore
of the brothers Chappe, of France, invented by them in 1794, was the
most perfect instrument of the kind, and was generally employed for
telegraphic purposes, until it was supplanted by the Electric Telegraph.

The semaphore consisted of an upright post, having arms on each side,
that could be readily extended, at any given angle. The extension of
these arms on one side or the other, either separately or together,
and at different angles, constituted a variety of signals sufficient
for the purposes of communication. The semaphores, erected on elevated
points, so as to be visible through telescopes, signalled intelligence
slowly from one station to another, till it reached its ultimate
destination; and thus--daylight and clear weather permitting--brief
orders could be sent from the Admiralty to Portsmouth in the course of
a few minutes. But the communication was liable to be interrupted by
fogs, as well as by nightfall.

A remarkable instance of the imperfection of sight telegraphs occurred
during the Peninsular War. A telegraphic despatch, received at the
Admiralty from Portsmouth, announced--"Lord Wellington defeated;"--and
then the communication was interrupted by a fog. This telegraphic
message caused great consternation, and the utmost anxiety was
experienced to learn the extent of the supposed disaster. When,
however, the fog dispersed, the remainder of the message gave a
completely opposite character to the news, which in its completed form
ran thus: "Lord Wellington defeated the French," &c.

Some better means of transmitting important intelligence was evidently
wanted; for not only was the semaphore liable to frequent interruptions
by the weather, but its action was very slow, and the frequent
repetitions from station to station increased the risk of blunders.

The instantaneous transmission of an electric shock suggested the
means of communicating with greatly increased rapidity; and when
it was ascertained, by experiments made by Dr. Watson at Shooter's
Hill, in 1747, that the charge of a Leyden jar could be sent through
a circuit of four miles, with velocity too great to be appreciable,
the practicability of applying electricity for conveying intelligence
became at once apparent.

Of the many means by which this object was attempted to be
accomplished, it will be only possible, in this general survey, to
notice those that mark the first steps of the invention, and the most
important of those that have accompanied its progress to the present
time.

The first method that suggested itself was to transmit signals by
means of pith-ball electrometers. When, for instance, two pith-balls
are suspended from a wire that is made to form part of an electric
circuit, the electricity communicated to the balls causes them to
diverge, and when the electricity in the wire is discharged, they
immediately collapse. This action of pith-balls, when electrified,
was the simplest mode known of making telegraphic signals, and it was
accordingly adopted by several of the early inventors of Electric
Telegraphs. The first person who proposed to apply it for that purpose
was M. Lesage, of Geneva, in 1774. His plan was to form 24 electric
circuits by as many separate wires, insulated from each other in glass
tubes; and to place in the circuit, at each communicating station,
an equal number of pith-ball electrometers. Each electrometer was to
represent a letter of the alphabet, and they were to be brought into
action by an excited glass rod. When a communication was to be made,
the wires connected with the separate galvanometers were to be charged
alternately with electricity by the excited rod of glass; and the
person at the receiving station, by noticing which of the electrometers
were successively put into action, could spell the words intended to be
communicated.

By the means thus proposed, correspondence could have taken place at
only short distances, for the charge of an excited glass rod would have
been too feeble to produce any sensible effect on the electrometers had
the length of the circuit been considerable. This difficulty might
have been overcome by substituting the charge of a Leyden jar for the
excited glass; but the more serious obstacle to the use of such a
telegraph would have been the cost, and the difficulty of insulating
the 24 wires required to work it.

Most of the early telegraphic inventors encumbered their inventions
with the same obstacle, as they seemed to consider it necessary to
have a separate circuit for each letter of the alphabet. It was not so
however, with all; for M. Lomond, a Frenchman, who ranks second in the
list of telegraphic inventors, modified the principle of M. Lesage, so
as to enable him to work with only two wires and one electrometer at
each station. With the experience since gained in the application of
the needle telegraph, such an arrangement seems very simple, and we are
inclined to wonder that it was not generally adopted, especially after
M. Lomond had shown the way.

To produce all the requisite signals with a single pith-ball
electrometer, it was necessary to vary the durations of each
divergence, and to combine several to form a single symbol. Thus,
suppose that a single divergence of the pith-balls for a second was
understood to signify the letter _A_; one divergence, followed by an
immediate collapse, by discharging the electricity, might signify _B_;
two prolonged divergences might signify _C_, and two short ones _D_;
and by thus increasing the number and varying the divergences of the
two pith-balls, all the letters of the alphabet might be indicated.

A still more direct method of representing the letters of the alphabet
was proposed by M. Reizen in 1794, by the application of the means
frequently adopted for exhibiting the light of the electric spark. The
charge of a Leyden jar was sent through strips of tin foil, pasted on
to a flat piece of glass, so as to form several lines, joined at the
ends alternately into a continuous circuit. Interruptions were made
in the foil by cutting small portions away, at which points brilliant
sparks appeared when the jar was discharged. As the interruptions
were so contrived as to form letters, and the strips of tin foil were
all arranged separately on a long pane of glass, any letter required
could be distinctly made visible by discharging the jar through that
particular circuit. To produce all the letters of the alphabet in this
manner, a separate circuit was required for each.

Another plan, far less feasible, and scarcely deserving of notice,
excepting for its peculiarity, was proposed in the following year
by M. Cavallo, who suggested the setting fire to combustibles, or
the explosion of detonating substances, as the means of signalling
intelligence. About the same time several attempts were made by
electricians in Spain to transmit signals by electricity, but their
plans were not more practicable than those already mentioned, and
depended for their effects on the discharge of Leyden jars.

The discovery of voltaic electricity at the beginning of the present
century was an important step in the progress of the Electric
Telegraph, though several years elapsed before the applicability of
the discovery for that purpose became known; and it was not fully
appreciated till within the last twenty years.

The electricity generated by the voltaic battery is far greater in
quantity than the most powerful electrical machine can excite, whilst
its intensity is so feeble that it cannot pass in a spark through the
smallest interval of air. It presents, therefore, much less difficulty
in the insulation of the wires than frictional electricity, whilst
the rapidity of its transmission is for practical purposes equally
efficient. The electricity generated by the voltaic battery being great
in quantity and feeble in intensity, it is capable also of effecting
chemical decomposition and of imparting magnetism, both of which
properties have proved eminently useful in perfecting the Electric
Telegraph.

The first application of voltaic electricity to telegraphic purposes
was made by Mr. Soemmering in 1809. The signals of his telegraph
consisted of the bubbles of gas arising from the decomposition of
water, during the action of the electric current. His apparatus
consisted of a small glass trough, filled with acidulated water,
through the bottom part of which were introduced several gold wires
corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. The instant that an
electric current was sent through any two of the wires, by making
connection with a voltaic battery at the transmitting instrument,
bubbles of hydrogen gas rose from one of the gold wires, and bubbles of
oxygen gas from another; and as the volume of hydrogen gas, liberated
during the decomposition of water, exceeds by sixteen times that of
