the oxygen, it was easy to distinguish them. In this manner all the
letters of the alphabet could be indicated by using 24 wires. The
object of having gold wires in the decomposing trough was to prevent
the oxidation of the metal; for had copper, or any other metal that
combines with oxygen, been employed, the points of the wires would soon
have become corroded.

This telegraph of Soemmering's, though not adapted for practical
application in the form he presented it, on account of the number of
wires required for the purpose, was nevertheless superior to any that
had previously been invented; and by a little modification it might
have been made a perfect instrument, capable of transmitting messages
by means of only two wires. Such a modification of the instrument was
proposed by M. Schweigger, twenty years afterwards; the only thing
required being the adoption of a code of symbols, by means of which
all the letters might be indicated by combinations of the four primary
signals that are obtainable by two wires, as is at present done by the
needle telegraph in common use. At that time, however, the discovery of
the magnetic properties of the electric current, and other improvements
in the means of communicating, superseded for some years the use of
signals made by electro-chemical decomposition.

The next important step in the progress of telegraphic invention, after
that of Mr. Soemmering, was made by Mr. Ronalds, who in 1816 succeeded
in making a perfect apparatus, that transmitted every requisite signal
with the use of only a single circuit. In the agent employed, however,
there was a retrogression to frictional electricity and the pith-ball
electrometer, for at that time the property which a voltaic current
possesses of deflecting a magnetic needle had not been discovered.

Mr. Ronalds's plan was to have, at each communicating station, a good
clock with a light paper disc fixed on to the seconds wheel, on which
were marked all the letters of the alphabet, and the ten numerals. Only
so much of this disc was exposed to view as to show a single letter
at a time, through a small aperture, as the seconds wheel revolved.
The clocks at the corresponding stations were set exactly together, so
that the same letter was exposed to view at each instrument at the same
instant. A pith-ball electrometer, connected in a single circuit with
the transmitting station, was kept distended during the transmission
of a message by charging the wire from an electrical machine; and when
the letter required to be indicated appeared at the aperture of both
instruments, the operator at the transmitting instrument instantly
discharged the electricity of the wire by touching it, and thus
caused the pith-balls to collapse. In this manner the person at the
receiving station, by attentively watching the pith-balls, and noticing
the letter that appeared at the instant of collapse, could read the
messages signalled.

Mr. Ronalds so far perfected his invention, that it worked accurately,
though slowly, through eight miles of wire insulated in glass tubes.
Having thus succeeded in putting into action his single wire
telegraph, Mr. Ronalds sought the patronage of Government for its
practical adoption, such a notion as that of establishing a telegraph
for commercial purposes not being at that time entertained. For a
length of time his application received no attention, and when at
length the Lords of the Admiralty condescended to answer, they sent Mr.
Ronalds, as the reward for his ingenuity, and as compensation for the
time and money bestowed in perfecting the invention, the expression of
their opinion--that "telegraphs are of no use in time of peace, and
that during war the semaphore answered all required purposes"! This
reply, so characteristic of the manner in which Government _employés_
generally regard anything new to which their attention is solicited,
completely disheartened Mr. Ronalds. He abandoned the Electric
Telegraph to its fate; and having gone abroad, he returned some years
later to find that, notwithstanding the _dictum_ of the Lords of the
Admiralty, telegraphs are of great use in time of peace as well as
of war, and that the old semaphore had been entirely superseded by
the means of transmission he had indicated twenty years before. Mr.
Ronalds has since received a small pension, not however as a reward
for his ingenious telegraph invention, but for his services in other
departments of science.

The discovery of the magnetic property of an electric current by
Professor Œrsted, in 1818, was most important in the subsequent
progress of telegraphic invention, though it was not applied in a
practical manner till nearly twenty years afterwards. In 1820, indeed,
M. Ampère submitted to the Academy of Sciences at Paris a telegraphic
instrument for the transmission of signals by the deflection of
needles, but he adopted the impracticable plan of the earliest
inventors, of having a separate wire for each letter of the alphabet. A
much more important contribution to telegraphic invention by M. Ampère
was the discovery of electro-magnets, which act an important part in
many recent electric telegraphs.

As the magnetic properties of a voltaic current are extensively applied
in electric telegraphs, it is desirable briefly to explain the nature
of the action of voltaic batteries before proceeding farther with the
history of the invention.

To excite a current of voltaic electricity, it is usual to employ a
series of zinc and copper plates, arranged alternately in separate
jars; or, what is now most common, in cells of gutta percha, separated
from each other in a gutta percha trough. The cells are nearly filled
with diluted sulphuric acid, and a wire is attached to each end of
the trough; one being connected with the last zinc plate, and the
other with the last copper plate of the opposite ends of the trough.
When these wires are brought into contact, electricity is instantly
generated by the action of the acid on the zinc plates. The electricity
excited by the action on the zinc in one cell is carried on to the
next, and that again excites and transfers an additional quantity to
the third cell, thus increasing in intensity to the last pair of plates
in the series. The _electric current_, as it is called, passes along
the wire, and whether the wire be one yard, or whether it be a hundred
miles long, the generation of electricity takes place the instant
that the circuit is completed, and ends the instant that the circuit
is broken. There is this difference, however, in the transmission of
electricity through a long and through a short circuit, that in the
former case the increased resistance offered by the length of the wire
greatly diminishes the quantity of electricity transmitted though it
does not perceptibly retard the velocity.

When a balanced magnetic needle is held above a short thick copper wire
whilst it is transmitting an electric current, the needle is deflected
from its natural position, and inclines either to the right or to the
left, according to the direction in which the current passes. If, for
instance, the north pole of the needle be pointed towards the copper
pole of the battery, it will be deflected towards the east, but if
the direction of the battery current be reversed, the deflection will
be towards the west. The effect instantly ceases when the current is
interrupted by breaking connection with either pole of the battery. The
copper wire, though under ordinary circumstances incapable of being
rendered magnetic, thus becomes endowed with strong magnetic properties
when it is transmitting an electric current, and acts on the magnetic
needle in the same manner as if there were an immense number of small
magnets placed along the wire across its diameter.

The magnetic property of an electric current, first discovered by
Œrsted, was applied by M. Ampère to impart magnetism to iron, by
coiling a length of copper wire round a bar of iron, taking care to
cover the wire with an insulating substance, so that when an electric
current was transmitted the electricity might not pass through the
iron. Coils of copper wire, covered with cotton or silk, can thus
impart most powerful magnetism to a piece of soft iron; but it loses
its magnetic power the instant that the electric current is interrupted.

The effect of a coil of insulated wire in increasing the magnetic
power of an electric current, was applied by M. Schweigger in 1832
to increase the sensitiveness of a suspended magnetic needle. By
surrounding a compass needle with several convolutions of covered wire,
it was found that the deflections of the needle were much greater
and more active; and he thus showed the way to the construction of
those delicate galvanometers, which indicate by their deflections
the slightest disturbance of electrical equilibrium. Schweigger may,
therefore, be considered the original inventor of the Needle Telegraph;
and as he pointed out a method of impressing symbols on paper
mechanically, by means of electro-magnets, he may be considered also as
the original inventor of Recording Electric Telegraphs.

The first near approach to the needle telegraph, now used in this
country, was made by Baron de Schilling, who, in 1832, constructed
at St. Petersburg an electric telegraph consisting of five magnetic
needles. This may be considered as the precursor of the five-needle
telegraph, first patented by Professor Wheatstone in 1837. By the
separate deflection of those needles to the right hand or to the
left, by reversing the connections with the poles of the batteries,
ten primary signals could be obtained; and by bringing two into
action at the same time, many more signals might be made than were
required for indicating the letters of the alphabet, and they could
be appropriated to express several words. For the action of this very
efficient telegraph only five wires were required, and the signals
being all primary ones, the messages might have been transmitted very
quickly.[6] In a subsequent modification of the telegraph, he contrived
to make all the signals with one magnetic needle alone, by repeating
the deflections to the right and to the left, as done in the needle
telegraph now generally used in England.

Another step made by Baron de Schilling was the invention of an
alarum to call attention when a message was about to be sent. Some
contrivance of this kind was considered essential in the early days of
the practical application of the Electric Telegraph, as no one then
contemplated that telegraphic communications would be so frequent as
to require a person to be always near the instrument, waiting for the
receipt of messages.

Baron de Schilling's alarum was very simple. One of the magnetic
needles acted as a detent which held a weight suspended, and when
the needle was deflected, the weight fell upon a bell. The alarums
subsequently invented were constructed on the same principle, but
instead of employing one of the magnetic needles as a detent, an
electro-magnet was used for the purpose, and clock mechanism was
introduced to sound a bell continuously, as soon as it was set in
action by the withdrawal of the detent. At the present time alarums are
not used in the regular stations of the electric telegraph companies;
the sound of the needles, as they strike against the ivory rests on
each side, being sufficient to call the attention of the clerks, who
are in constant attendance.

We have hitherto been enabled to trace, step by step, the advances
made at intervals--years asunder--in bringing the Electric Telegraph
into practical use; but we are now approaching a time when it becomes
difficult to enumerate, and impossible to describe within reasonable
compass, the numerous inventions that were patented and otherwise made
known for giving greater efficiency to that means of communication.

In the early part of the year 1837, the electric telegraphs of Mr.
Alexander, of Edinburgh, and of Mr. Davy, were publicly exhibited
in London, and excited much attention; though, at that time it was
not supposed that it would be possible to make use of that means of
communication for general purposes. Mr. Alexander's telegraph was the
same in principle as those of M. Ampère and of Baron de Schilling,
though in some respects not so efficient as either, for its action was
slow, and it required a separate wire for each letter of the alphabet.
It was considered a great advantage of this telegraph at the time,
that it exhibited actual letters of the alphabet, instead of symbols.
This was effected by having the twenty-six letters painted on a board,
and concealed from view by a number of small paper screens, which were
attached to magnetic needles. When any of the needles was deflected
by sending an electric current through the surrounding coil, the
screen was withdrawn and exposed the letter behind. Twenty-six keys,
resembling those of a pianoforte, were ranged in connection, one with
each wire, and on pressing down any one of the keys, contact was made
between the battery and the wire connected with its associated magnetic
needle; and in this manner, messages might easily be transmitted
and read. The objections to this telegraph, in the form in which it
was exhibited, were not only the impracticability of laying down
and insulating so many wires, but the paper screens attached to the
needles impeded their action, and rendered the transmission a very slow
process. It is questionable, indeed, whether that telegraph could have
been worked at all through a circuit of many miles.

Mr. Davy's telegraph was similar to that of Mr. Alexander's, though
much more compact and better arranged. The letters were painted on
ground glass, lighted behind, so that when the screens were withdrawn
the letters were seen in transparency.

[Illustration]

Professor Wheatstone, who had for some previous years been endeavouring
to perfect a practical electric telegraph, took out his first patent
in 1837. It closely resembled in general features the telegraph of
Baron de Schilling. It consisted of five magnetic needles, ranged side
by side on a horizontal line that formed the diameter of a rhomb. The
needles were suspended perpendicularly, being kept in that position by
having the lower ends made slightly heavier than the upper. The rhomb
was divided into thirty-six equal parts by ten cross lines, and the
needles were placed at the points where the lines intersected, as shown
in the diagram.

At each intersection, and along the boundary lines of the rhomb,
letters were marked, any one of which might be pointed at by the
combined action of two of the needles. Thus, if the two extreme needles
were deflected inwards, one towards the left and the other towards the
right, they would point to the letter _A_ at the top of the rhomb.
If the extreme needle on the left and the fourth one were similarly
deflected, they would point to the letter _B_; and thus all the letters
marked on the intersections of the lines could be pointed to. A
telegraph that could be worked with five circuits came within the range
of practicability, and it was put into operation on the Great Western
Railway as far as Slough, a distance of 18 miles.

When the work of actually making communication by insulated wires
between places far apart came to be done, much difficulty arose as to
the best and cheapest mode of doing it. The plan first attempted was
to surround the wires with pitch, and to bury them in a trench in the
ground. But this was found to be attended with great inconvenience, for
the pitch cracked, and electric communication was established between
the adjacent wires. The method of suspending the wires on posts was, we
understand, suggested by Mr. Brunel, who had seen wires so suspended
for other purposes on the Continent, and he recommended it to Mr. Cooke
for the Electric Telegraph. The plan was tried with success, and
was generally adopted by the Electric Telegraph Company in extending
their lines over the country. We shall have occasion to revert to this
practical part of the subject, when describing more particularly the
means of making communication from one place to another.

In continuing the history of the invention, as regards the different
modes by which communications are transmitted along the insulated
wires, the next telegraphs that deserve notice are those of Dr.
Steinheil, which became known also in 1837. One of his telegraphs made
the signals by sounds, produced by magnetic needles striking, when
deflected, against bells of different tones. By another telegraph
of his invention the symbols where marked upon paper by small tubes
holding ink, fixed to the needles. In this manner the letters of the
alphabet were indicated by dots upon a strip of paper, kept slowly
moving by clock mechanism. This telegraph could be worked by a
single circuit; and it appears that Dr. Steinheil was the first who
discovered, or at least who practically applied, the conducting power
of the earth for the return current. Each circuit, therefore, consisted
of only a single wire; the wire that had been previously used to
complete the circuit being superseded by burying in the earth, at each
terminus, a small copper plate. Dr. Steinheil also introduced the use
of galvanized iron wire. An electric telegraph of this construction was
put into operation at Munich, through a distance of 12 miles.

[Illustration]

In the following year Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone so far simplified
the arrangements of their needle telegraph as to make all the requisite
signals with two needles. With a single combined battery and two wires
six primary signals are thus obtained; and by repeating the deflections
and combining the action of the two needles, all the letters can
be readily and quickly indicated. A single needle instrument was
invented by Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone, but as there are only two
primary signals, one to the right and one to the left, the deflections
are necessarily repeated more frequently, and the transmission is
consequently more slow. The accompanying diagram represents the
alphabet of the single needle instrument. The deflections for each
letter commence in the direction of the short marks, and end with
the long ones. Thus, to indicate the letter _R_, the needle is first
deflected once to the left and then once to the right; and the letter
_D_ has the deflections reversed, beginning with one to the right and
ending with one to the left. In no instance does it require more than
four deflections to indicate a single letter, yet the transmission
with the double needle is found so much quicker that the single needle
instrument is only rarely used.

At the end of each word, it is customary for the clerk at the receiving
station to indicate, by a deflection of the needle to the right, that
he understands, or by a deflection to the left, that he does not
understand, and in the latter case the word is repeated. In the early
days of the Electric Telegraph, the transmission of 40 letters a minute
with the double needle instrument was considered quick work; but the
practised clerks will now transmit one hundred letters in that time,
which is as fast as any person can write with pen and ink.

Since the invention of the double and single needle telegraphs there
have been many modifications in the instruments, to make them work
more promptly and with less vibration; but in all essential parts
the telegraphs of Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone remain unaltered, and
continue to be generally used in this country.

Of the numerous other telegraph instruments that have been invented
since 1837, that of Mr. Morse is in most general use, especially on the
Continent and in America. Mr. Morse, indeed, claims to be the first
inventor of a practical Electric Telegraph; for, according to his
statement, he, in 1832, invented a telegraph, which was in principle
the same as the one now in use. It was not, however, till September,
1838, that he made his instrument known in Europe, by sending a
description of it with a model to the Academy of Sciences at Paris.
Mr. Jackson, an American, disputed with Mr. Morse for the honour of
the invention, and when the latter asserted that he had described his
telegraph in 1832, to some passengers on board a packet-boat, Mr.
Jackson affirmed that it was he who described it on that occasion, and
that Mr. Morse, being present, got the idea from him. It is painful
and difficult to decide when we find two claimants thus directly
in opposition to each other, and mutually preferring charges of
falsehood and fraud. The only safe guide in such cases is to refer to
the earliest published and authentic descriptions of the inventions;
and, following that guidance, the invention of what is called Morse's
telegraph must be attributed to him whose name it bears; but we must,
according to the same rule, date it several years later than 1832.

Mr. Morse's telegraph is a recording instrument, that embosses
the symbols upon paper, with a point pressed down upon it by an
electro-magnet. The symbols that form the alphabet consist of
combinations of short and long strokes, which by their repetitions and
variations, are made to stand for different letters. Thus a stroke
followed by a dot signifies the letter _A_; a stroke preceded by a
dot, the letter _B_; a single dot, the letter _E_; and in this manner
the whole alphabet is indicated, the number of repetitions in no case
exceeding four for each letter. The letters and words are distinguished
from one another by a longer space being left between them than
between each mark that forms only a part of a letter or of a word. The
annexed diagram represents the symbols for the whole alphabet.

[Illustration]

The mechanism of this telegraph instrument is very simple. The
transmitter is merely a spring key, like that of a musical instrument,
which, on being pressed down, makes contact with the voltaic battery,
and sends an electric current to the receiving station. The operator at
the transmitting station, by thus making contact, brings into action an
electro-magnet at the station he communicates with, and that pulls down
a point fixed to the soft iron lever upon a strip of paper that is kept
moving by clockwork slowly under it. The duration of the pressure on
the key, whether instantaneous or prolonged for a moment, occasions the
difference in the lengths of the lines indented on the paper. A single
circuit is sufficient for this telegraph, and a boy who is practised
in the use of the instrument will transmit nearly as many words in a
minute as can be sent by the double needle telegraph with two wires.

The working of Mr. Morse's telegraph, it will be observed, depends
altogether upon bringing into action at the receiving station an
electro-magnet of sufficient force to mechanically indent paper. Now
the resistance to the passage of electricity along the wires diminishes
the quantity transmitted so greatly, that at long distances it would
be almost impossible to obtain sufficient power for the purpose,
if it acted directly. To overcome that difficulty, an auxiliary
electro-magnet is employed. The electro-magnet which is directly in
connection with the telegraph wire is a small one, surrounded by about
500 yards of very fine wire, for the purpose of multiplying as much as
possible the effect of the feeble current that is transmitted. The soft
iron keeper, which is attracted by that magnet, is also very light,
so that it may be the more readily attracted. This highly sensitive
instrument serves to make and break contact with a local battery, which
brings into action a large electro-magnet, and as the local battery and
the magnet are close to the place where the work is to be done, any
required force may be easily obtained. By this means the marks may be
impressed on the paper at distances of 400 miles or more apart.

This is a very efficient and remarkably simple telegraph, and as it
operates with a single wire, it has completely supplanted the needle
telegraph on the Continent; though the liability to error, common to
all manipulated telegraphs, is considerably increased by this mode of
transmission, nor can unintelligible signals be indicated and corrected
so readily as by the needle instrument.

There have been several modifications of Mr. Morse's telegraph, for the
purpose of increasing the rapidity of its action and the distinctness
of the marks. The most important of these was made by Mr. Bain, who
in 1847 applied for this purpose the method of impressing the symbols
on paper by electro-chemical decomposition. Mr. Davy had, in 1843,
taken out a patent for the application of electro-chemical marks to
telegraphic purposes, but his method was not sufficiently practical
to be brought into use. Mr. Bain adopted an alphabet of short and
long strokes, similar to that of Mr. Morse; but instead of making and
breaking contact by a key pressed down by the finger, he punched holes
in a strip of paper, corresponding in lengths and positions to the
marks intended to be transmitted. A small metal spring, connected with
the voltaic battery, pressed upon a metal cylinder attached to the
telegraph wire, and when the spring and cylinder touched, an electric
current was transmitted. The strip of punched paper was placed upon the
cylinder so as to interrupt the circuit, excepting in the parts where
the apertures allowed the spring to make contact; therefore when the
strip of paper was moved along, an electric current was transmitted
through the apertures, and it was stopped when the paper intervened.
At the receiving station, paper well moistened with a solution of
prussiate of potass and nitric acid was placed upon a corresponding
cylinder to receive the message, and a piece of steel wire was kept
steadily pressed upon it as it moved along. The action of the electric
current at the parts where it was transmitted caused the acid to enter
into combination with the steel, and the consequent deposition of iron
on the paper was instantly converted by the prussiate of potass into
Prussian blue. On the parts where the electric current was interrupted
no action took place, and thus numbers of short and long marks were
made on the paper, corresponding to the lengths of the apertures
on the prepared message. A representation of the punched paper for
transmitting the word "Bain" is shown in this diagram.

[Illustration]

As electro-chemical action takes effect much more rapidly than the
mechanical movement of an indenting point, Mr. Bain's telegraph could
work much faster than Mr. Morse's. We have been informed that as many
as 1,000 letters per minute have occasionally been transmitted by
this means from Manchester to London. The disadvantage attending that
mode of transmission arises from the tedious process of punching the
message preparatory to transmission; and though circumstances may arise
in which it would be of great importance to adopt this rapid system
of transmission with a single wire, it has been yet but little used
in this country by the Electric Telegraph Company, who purchased Mr.
Bain's patent for £10,000.

Another modification of Mr. Morse's telegraph, which has been more
extensively adopted in England, consists in merely substituting marks
made on paper by electro-chemical decomposition for those indented
by pressure. It has been found desirable in practice, however, to
introduce an auxiliary electro-magnet, called a "picker," for making
and breaking contact, by which arrangement the dotted marks can be
made by a local battery, and any required amount of electric power be
obtained. The marks produced in this manner are more distinct, and
are more quickly made, than by mechanical pressure. By a more recent
application of Mr. Morse's system, the marks are made on paper with ink
flowing through a glass pen, in the same manner as in the telegraph of
M. Schweigger, already noticed. As the strip of paper is moved along,
a continuous line is thus drawn on the paper. When no signals are
being transmitted the line is straight, but when an electric current
is sent through the wire, it brings into action an electro-magnet,
which attracts the penholder on one side, and alters the direction of
the mark. The transmission is effected by making and breaking contact
with a key, and the continuance of the divergence of the mark from
its normal direction is regulated by the duration of pressure on the
key. The symbols are thus made by deviations from the straight line,
of different lengths and of varied combinations. Practical application
alone can determine whether this mode of making the marks possesses any
advantage over Mr. Morse's original plan. The patent for this telegraph
was granted to Mr. Wilkins in 1854, but a similar instrument, applied
to the notation of astronomical observations, was shown in the American
department of the Great Exhibition of 1851.

The recording telegraph instruments hitherto noticed impress on the
paper only hieroglyphical symbols, which require long practice to
decipher readily. It has, from the first practical application of the
invention, been considered highly desirable that the letters of the
alphabet should be indicated and printed in their proper forms, so that
the momentary transmission of an electric current should leave behind
a durable impression that could be read without difficulty. Professor
Wheatstone and Mr. Bain separately attempted to accomplish this desired
object by the invention of Printing Telegraphs, which print messages
from types. It is a question in dispute which of them was the first
to design a telegraph of this kind. In 1845, Mr. Bain had a printing
telegraph in operation experimentally on the South-Western Railway,
for a distance of seven miles, and we are not aware that Professor
Wheatstone ever succeeded in working his printing instruments when
separated at a distance from each other. In principle, both inventions
were similar. A wheel, into the periphery of which were inserted types
of the twenty-six letters, was made to rotate in close proximity to a
piece of paper, over which was placed a blackened surface that would
leave a mark on the paper when pressed upon. When the required letter
came opposite the paper, the type-wheel was stopped and forced against
it, so that the letter was impressed, and the black from the interposed
surface marked the form of the type. The paper was then moved forward
to leave space for the next letter, and thus a continuous message could
be printed. The objection to these instruments was the uncertainty of
stopping the type-wheel at the proper point, so as to avoid printing
wrong letters; and when the instruments became thus irregular, they
continued so till they were again adjusted. This difficulty has since
been overcome; and by the combined efforts of Mr. House in America,
and of Messrs. Brett in this country, the printing telegraph has
attained a high degree of perfection. The mechanical arrangements of
the instrument, though very complex, consist essentially, like those of
Mr. Bain and Professor Wheatstone, in having a type-wheel, which, by
the action of the operator at the transmitting instrument in making and
breaking contact, moves or stops at the required point, and the letters
are printed by forcing the paper against the type by an electro-magnet.
The movements of the type-wheel are regulated by an electro-magnet, and
one great improvement introduced by Mr. Brett prevents the continuance
of error, should any be made during transmission, by bringing the
type-wheel to its first position after printing each letter, so that
if a wrong letter be printed, the subsequent letters will not continue
erroneous. This printing telegraph works with a single wire, but its
operation is rather slow.

The last recording telegraph we shall notice is the one invented by the
author, which transmits copies of the handwriting of correspondents.
The communication to be transmitted is written upon tin foil, thinly
coated with varnish, with a pen dipped in an ink composed of caustic
soda and colouring matter. The alkali detaches the varnish, and when
the surface is washed over with a wet sponge, the metal is exposed
on those parts written upon, the writing appearing metallic on a
dark ground. The message is then placed round a metal cylinder that
is connected with the line wire from the receiving station. A brass
point, in connection with the voltaic battery, lightly presses on
the message as the cylinder rotates, so that the electric circuit is
made and broken through the message as it passes under the connecting
point, the coating of varnish on the foil being sufficient to interrupt
the electric current in those parts where the point is resting upon
it. On a corresponding cylinder in the electric circuit, at the
receiving station, paper moistened with a solution of prussiate of
potass and nitrate of soda is placed to receive the message; and it
is pressed upon by the point of a steel wire, in connection with the
communicating wire. The accompanying diagram will assist in explaining
the arrangement.

The cylinder of the instrument is shown at _a_; _b_ is the metal
style connected by the wire _g_ with one of the poles of the voltaic
battery; _o_ is the arm which holds the style and serves to insulate
it from the rest of the apparatus; _c_ is a fine screw on which that
arm traverses as the cylinder revolves; _d d_ are cog-wheels to turn
the screw. The speed of the instrument is regulated by the fan _e_; _f_
is the impelling weight, and _h_ the wire connected with the distant
instrument. The receiving and the transmitting instruments are alike,
the only difference between them being that the style of the copying
instrument is steel instead of brass wire.

[Illustration]

As the cylinder _a_ is connected by the wire _h_ with the distant
instrument, and through it with one of the poles of the voltaic
battery, the electric circuit is completed by passing from _g_
through the tin foil message, or through the paper placed on the
cylinder. This will be the case whenever the style of the transmitting
instrument is pressing on the metallic writing; and at those times the
electro-chemical action of the voltaic current will produce a blue mark
on the paper of the receiving instrument, by the deposition of iron and
its combination with the prussiate of potass. The circuit will in like
manner be interrupted whenever the point _b_ presses on those parts
of the message where the varnish is not removed; and thus, as the two
cylinders revolve, there will be a succession of small blue marks on
the parts where the writing allows the electric current to pass. As the
arms that carry the points traverse on screws, they are drawn along
as the cylinders rotate, so as to press on fresh parts of the message
and of the paper at each revolution. The steel point would therefore
draw a series of spiral lines on the paper, if the electric current
were not interrupted; but the interposition of the varnish breaks those
lines, and as the point passes over different portions of the letters
at each revolution of the cylinder, the marks and the interruptions on
the paper correspond exactly with the forms of the letters, and thus
produce a copy of the writing placed upon the receiving cylinder, in
blue characters on a yellowish ground. Or the message may be written
on unprepared tin foil with a pen dipped in varnish; in which case the
writing will be copied in white characters on a ground of dark lines,
as in the accompanying specimen, _A_ being the writing on tin foil, and
_B_ the message received.

It is essential to the perfect working of the copying telegraph that
the corresponding instruments should rotate exactly together. This is
effected by an electromagnetic regulator, which being put in action by
one instrument, governs the movements of the distant instrument with
the greatest exactness, as proved at a distance of 300 miles.

It might be supposed, as the points must traverse several times over
the same line of writing to copy it, that the process is a slow one;
but in consequence of the rapidity with which the cylinders revolve,
this is not the case. The ordinary speed is one rotation in two
seconds, and at that rate three lines of writing, containing sixty
words, would be copied in one minute, which is three times as fast as
an expeditious penman can write.

[Illustration]

The advantages proposed to be gained by the copying telegraph,
in addition to its increased rapidity of transmission, are the
authentication of telegraphic correspondence by the signatures of the
writers, freedom from the errors of transmission, and the maintenance
of secrecy. As a special means of obtaining secrecy, the messages may
be received on paper moistened with a solution of nitrate of soda
alone, in which case they would be invisible until brushed over with a
solution of prussiate of potass, to be applied by the person to whom
the communication is addressed.

Professor Wheatstone has recently contrived an improvement in his index
telegraph, which was described by Professor Faraday in a lecture at
the Royal Institution in June last. Its chief merit, however, consists
in the beauty of the mechanism, for it is essentially the same as the
index telegraphs he and others have previously invented, with the
substitution of magneto-electricity for the moving force.

Having now traced the history of the invention of the instruments by
means of which messages may be transmitted, it becomes necessary to
describe the methods employed for making the electrical connection from
one place to another. This part of the electric telegraph system is,
after all, the most essential to its efficient working, and bears the
same relation to the transmitting instruments that the structure of a
railroad does to locomotive engines in the system of railway conveyance.

The fact that an electric current might be sent through a long circuit
had been established by Dr. Watson, in conjunction with other Fellows
of the Royal Society, in 1747, when they sent the charge of a Leyden
jar through two miles of wire, supported upon short sticks driven into
the ground; the wire at each terminus being connected with the earth
for the return current. This method of insulation and conduction fully
answered the purpose, and served to determine the great velocity with
which electricity is transmitted, for no perceptible interval occurred
between the discharge of the Leyden jar at one end of the circuit, and
its effect at the other extremity.

Mr. Ronalds made the next experiment on an extensive scale, by
insulating eight miles of wire in glass tubes, the wire being carried
backwards and forwards for that distance on his lawn at Hammersmith.
That mode of insulation was found very efficient. It was, indeed, too
perfect, for the difficulty arose of discharging the electricity from
the wire after the charge had passed through it.

The length of telegraphic communication established at Munich, in 1837,
by Dr. Steinheil, was an important practical advance in the system of
extending and insulating the wires, and deserves consideration, not
only from the extent to which it was carried into practical operation,
but from the circumstance that the earth was employed to form the
return circuit. The wires appear to have been carried through the city
by extending them from the church towers and other elevated buildings.
That plan, indeed, presents so many facilities for passing telegraph
wires through towns, that it is not improbable it may be ultimately
adopted in this country.

Though the conducting power of the earth was thus early made use of for
one-half of the circuit, the fact seems to have been unknown in England
at the time of laying down the telegraph wires to Slough in 1845,
for a separate wire was then used for the return current. Some years
afterwards, indeed, Mr. Bain laid claim to the discovery; but the fact
that the conducting power of the earth had been previously applied to
the purpose by Dr. Steinheil has been incontestably proved.

In the early stages of the practical application of electric telegraphs
in this country, Mr. Cook took an active part in overcoming the
numerous difficulties attending the proper protection and insulation
of the wires. In the first instance, the plan of burying the wires in
trenches was tried, but with very indifferent success, as the asphaltum
and other resinous substances with which it was attempted to insulate
them were inadequate for the purpose, and allowed the electricity to
escape from wire to wire. The method of supporting the wires on tall
posts was then adopted by Mr. Cooke, the wires being insulated from
the posts at the points of suspension, by passing them through quills.
Various improvements have since been made in the insulators, and the
plan most in favour at present is to pass the wires through globular
earthenware or glass insulators, attached to the posts, as shown in the
annexed diagram. The wires themselves are about one-sixth of an inch in
diameter; they are made of iron coated with zinc, or galvanized, as it
is termed, to protect them from rust.

[Illustration]

Notwithstanding the great care taken to insulate the wires at the
posts, a large quantity of the electricity escapes in wet weather,
and returns to the battery without having reached the most distant
stations, and thus not unfrequently the communications are interrupted.
The author is of opinion that the loss of electricity in wet weather
is occasioned rather by communication from one wire to another
through the moist atmosphere, than by defective insulation at the
posts. In confirmation of this opinion it may be stated, that he has
experimentally determined that a working electric current might be
transmitted from London to Liverpool, if all the points of attachment
were connected by water with the surface of the ground, provided that
the rest of the wire were insulated.[7]

The use of gutta percha as an insulating covering for wire has given
rise to a new era in telegraphic communication. Gutta percha is an
excellent insulator, and wire covered with two coatings of that
material, about one-sixteenth of an inch each, is so far protected,
that 100 miles of it immersed in water transmits an electric current
from a powerful voltaic battery with very trifling loss. This
perfection in insulation has greatly facilitated the establishment of
telegraphic communication between England and the Continent. The first
attempt to establish a submarine circuit between Dover and Calais took
place on the 28th of August, 1850. A single copper wire, about the
thickness of a common bell wire, coated thickly with gutta percha, was
laid across the English Channel experimentally, without any protection.
It proved sufficient for the transmission of an electric current, and
several messages were sent through it between Dover and Calais; but
it was far too feeble to resist the action of the waves, and the
following day it was cut through by friction against the rocks, and the
communication was stopped.

[Illustration]

The plan afterwards adopted for a permanent submarine line was to
enclose five similar wires in a hollow iron wire cable. The wires
were first slightly twisted, to prevent them from being broken when
stretched. They were then covered with hempen yarn, to protect the
gutta percha from attrition, and they were thus introduced into the
hollow cable, of which they formed the core. The accompanying woodcut
represents this structure of the cable; the five twisted wires are
shown at _C_; _B_ represents the same covered with hemp yarn; and
_A_ a portion of the completed cable, constructed of thick iron wire
galvanized. This cable has now been laid down for seven years, and with
perfect success. Its strength has often been severely tested, as it has
been sometime drawn up by ships' anchors, and considerably strained;
but it has not been broken, and the insulation is almost perfect. The
success of this submarine cable has induced the extension of that means
of communicating with the Continent, and similar submarine telegraph
cables have been laid down from Dover to Ostend, from Harwich to the
Hague, from Scotland to Ireland, and across the Mediterranean Sea as
far as Malta. The weight and the cost of those cables present a serious
obstacle to their adoption in forming a telegraphic communication with
America; and when it was determined to attempt to establish electrical
connection with the New World, a different form of cable was adopted.
The conductor of the electric current in the Atlantic cable is composed
of seven strands of fine copper wire twisted together, the aggregate
thickness of which is not greater than the single copper wire of other
submarine cables. This fine copper cord is covered carefully with gutta
percha; it is then coated with tarred hemp, and is protected externally
by an iron wire rope, composed of numerous strands of fine wire. The
form and exact size of the cable are shown in the accompanying drawing
and section. The central dots in the section are the conducting wires
round which are the gutta percha and hemp, and the outer rim represents
the iron wire casing.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The successful laying down of so frail a cable, after many failures,
affords good ground for hoping that, with the experience already
gained, subsequent efforts will prove more satisfactory and much
less expensive than this first attempt to establish telegraphic
communication with America. The most questionable part of the problem
has, indeed, been already solved; for the transmission of electric
signals, through that length of submerged wire, was at one time
doubted; and though the communication through the present cable has
ceased, it has sufficiently established the fact, that telegraphic
communication with America is a practicable undertaking.

The excellent insulation obtained by means of gutta percha covered
wires has caused a return to the original plan of burying the wires in
trenches in the ground. The British and Submarine Telegraph Company
make all their communications by that means; the number of coated wires
required being enclosed in iron tubes, and laid in the ground along
the common roads. That plan is, however, attended with considerable
disadvantages. In the first place, the cost of the coated copper wire
is more than quadruple that of galvanized iron wire; and though copper,
compared with iron, offers only one-seventh part the resistance to the
transmission of electricity, yet the thin wire employed is scarcely
equal in conducting power to the galvanized iron wire usually supported
on posts. The quantity of electricity transmitted is therefore less,
and the comparative intensity of it is greater.

Another difficulty attending the use of insulated wires buried in the
ground arises from a very peculiar condition of electrical conduction,
that could scarcely have been anticipated. The wire, coated with
gutta percha, and surrounded externally with water or with moist
earth, becomes an elongated Leyden jar; the gutta percha representing
the glass, the wire the inside coating, and the water the conducting
surface outside. Thus, when electricity is transmitted through such a
medium, a portion of the charge is retained after connection with the
battery has been broken. This effect increases with the length of the
wire and the intensity of the current; and it materially interferes
with the working of many telegraph instruments. In some experiments
with the copying telegraph at the Gutta Percha Works in the City Road,
it was found that through a circuit of 50 miles of wire immersed in
water, the mark made by electro-chemical decomposition on paper had
a tendency to become continuous; so that instead of ceasing to mark,
when the varnish interrupted the current, a line was drawn continuously
on the paper, though the stronger marks where the current passed were
sufficient to make the writing legible. The retention of the charge
was also shown still more remarkably by the explosion of gunpowder by
the electricity retained in the wire half a minute after connection
with the battery had been broken. It is owing to the retention of the
electricity by the wire that the slowness with which the messages
through the Atlantic cable were transmitted is to be attributed, and
not to the length of the cable. The rate of one word a minute was the
average speed of transmission when the first messages were sent through
the wire. The effect of the _retardation_ of the electric current is
comparatively insignificant and were it not for the peculiar action of
the surrounding water, the messages might have been transmitted twelve
times faster than they were.

The cost of constructing a telegraphic line has greatly diminished
with the increased facilities of insulating the wires, and since the
expiration of patents, which conferred a monopoly on certain plans of
doing so. The cost to the Great Western Railway Company for a line of
six wires to Slough, was £150 per mile, with comparatively low and
slender posts and very imperfect insulation. The cost of the same
number of wires at the present day would not be one-half that sum, with
thicker wires and better insulation.

It is customary in England to restrict the suspension of telegraphic
wires to railways, from the notion that the protection of railways is
necessary to prevent wilful damage to the wires; and as the Electric
Telegraph Company have made exclusive arrangements with all the railway
companies out of London, the competing telegraph companies have
preferred to lay their wires underground rather than incur the supposed
risk of damage to the wires if suspended from posts on common roads,
though by this means the cost of construction is at least quadrupled.
The protection which railways afford is, however, more imaginary than
real, for any one inclined to interrupt the communication could easily
do so; and if on common roads proper precautions were taken in fixing
the posts, and a heavy penalty were imposed on wilful offenders, the
common roads and open fields would, there can be little doubt, offer
as safe a course for the telegraphic wires as railways.

The conducting power of the earth is now employed by all electric
telegraph companies for one-half of every circuit. Thus, whether a
communication be sent from London to Liverpool, to Edinburgh, Paris,
or Brussels, the moist earth serves to complete one-half of the
communication. In the telegraphic circuit between London and Liverpool,
for example, the insulated wire is connected at each end with the
earth by being soldered to a copper plate, which is buried a few feet
underground, so as to insure its being always surrounded with moisture.
To improve the connection of this plate with the earth, it is customary
to bury with it a quantity of sulphate of copper, the solution of which
surrounds the earth-plate with a better conducting liquid than water,
and thus extends the connecting surface. The gas pipes or water pipes
are sometimes employed for the attachment of the wires instead of an
earth-plate, but the latter is generally preferred.

In arranging a telegraphic circuit, the voltaic batteries and the
instruments are introduced at breaks in the telegraph wire. The course
of the electric current is from the copper end of the battery through
the transmitting instrument, then along the wire to the receiving
instrument; from that it passes to the earth and is thus returned to
the transmitting station, where it completes the circuit by being
conducted from the earth-plate to the zinc end of the voltaic battery.
The arrangement for completing the circuit will be more clearly
understood by reference to the accompanying diagram.

[Illustration]

The wire from _C_, which is the copper pole of the voltaic battery,
is connected with the instrument _A_; the electric current is then
transmitted along the wire _D_ to the receiving instrument _B_; thence
it is transferred to the earth-plate _E_, passes through the earth to
the corresponding plate _E´_, which is connected with _Z_, the zinc
pole of the battery. When a communication is returned from _B_ to _A_,
a similar arrangement is made; the wires connected with the instruments
being so arranged as to bring into action a voltaic battery at _B_, and
to throw out of circuit the one at _A_; for the connection with the
battery is only made when the transmitting instrument is worked.

Since all the electric telegraphs in different parts of the world are
connected with the earth, as one portion of the circuit, it might
be supposed that the various currents would mingle, and occasion a
confusion of messages; but it must be borne in mind that no electric
current is formed until a communication be made from one pole of a
voltaic battery to the other, and as such communication can only be
completed through the insulated wire, the earth-currents cannot
mingle, but each one passes to the proper terminus of its respective
battery. The accompanying diagram and explanation may serve to remove
the difficulty of understanding why the two circuits are maintained
quite distinct.

[Illustration]

The letters _A_ _B_ represent the wires making communications between
the batteries _D_ and _E_, and the telegraph instruments _I_ _O_ at the
receiving station. The electricity from the copper end of the battery
_D_ would be conducted along _A_ through the instrument _I_, and by
the wire _K_ to the earth-plate _H_. It would be then transmitted
through the earth on its return to the battery, in the direction of the
arrows, to the other earth-plate _G_, and thence it would find its way
to the zinc pole of the battery _D_, and complete the circuit. In the
same manner, the electric current from the copper end of the battery
_E_ would be transmitted through the wire _B_, and would complete its
current also by means of the earth-plates _G_ _H_, and would traverse
the course indicated by the arrows, and return to the zinc end of
_E_. Though both electric currents traverse the same wire from the
instruments _I_ _O_ to the earth-plate _H_, and are thence transmitted
through the earth to a single plate, _G_, at the transmitting station,
there is no mingling of currents, the electric current of each battery
being kept as distinct as if separate wires were used both for the
transmitted and the return current. It would, indeed, be as impossible
for the separate currents transmitted from the two batteries to be
mingled together, as it would be for the written contents of two
letters enclosed in the same mail-bag to intermix.[8]

The length of telegraph lines at present laid down by the several
telegraph companies in Great Britain, exceeds 10,000 miles. To complete
those lines required 40,000 miles of wire, and there are 3,000 persons
engaged in the transmission of telegraphic intelligence.

In North America there is a direct communication from New York to New
Orleans, a distance of 2,000 miles, through the whole length of which
wires messages can be transmitted without any break. Wires have also
been suspended on lofty posts across the Indian Peninsula, where no
railways have been yet laid down. Lines of insulated wire, partly
submerged in the sea, partly buried underground, and partly suspended
on posts in the air, place London and Vienna in direct communication;
and other telegraph lines are in the course of construction, which will
unite London with Africa: and a complete net-work of telegraph wires is
spreading over the face of Europe.

It will not be long before this system of communication is connected
with a similar one in America. The failure of the cable already laid
down has confirmed the opinion of the author, expressed in papers
read at meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, and in his work on Electricity, that the conducting wire
should be sufficiently strong to be self-protective, without requiring
an external coating of iron wire rope. A conducting copper wire, a
quarter of an inch in diameter, covered with gutta percha and tarred
hemp, would be more flexible and stronger than the combined cable;
and it being a much better conductor of electricity, the rapidity of
transmission would be greatly increased.

The effect of the establishment of competing telegraph companies in
England has been to diminish the charge for transmitting messages, in
some instances to one-fifth of the rate formerly demanded; and when
further experience in the construction of telegraphic lines, and the
adoption of more rapidly transmitting instruments, have facilitated
and improved the means of communication, we may anticipate that
correspondence by Electric Telegraph will in a great measure supersede
the transmission of letters by post.




ELECTRO-MAGNETIC CLOCKS.


The invention of Electro-Magnetic Clocks closely followed the
introduction of the electric telegraph; and Professor Wheatstone,
to whom the world is principally indebted, in conjunction with Mr.
Cooke, for the perfection and application of the needle telegraphic
instrument, claims also to be the original inventor of Electro-Magnetic
Clocks. His claim is, however, disputed by Mr. Bain, who asserts that
he was the first who conceived the idea of applying the power of
electro-magnets to the regulation and movements of clocks, and it must
be admitted that he brought the invention into a working state.

In the first stage of the invention, the object attempted to be
attained was to regulate several clocks, once an hour--or oftener, if
required--so that they might all indicate precisely the same time.
For this purpose Mr. Bain took for a standard time-keeper a clock of
the best possible construction, placed in circumstances favourable
to maintaining accuracy. The minute-hand of his clock, the instant
that it pointed to the hour, made connection with a voltaic battery
that brought into action a series of electro-magnets attached to the
clocks to be regulated; one of them being fixed on the top of each
clock. Its momentary action was made to collapse a pair of clippers,
which in closing seized the minute-hand of the clock to which it was
attached, and brought it to the hour point. Thus all the clocks in
the series could be regulated every hour, for the collapse of the
clippers pushed the hand forward if it were too late, or thrust it
back if it had gained. Mr. Bain contemplated the application of this
contrivance to all the public clocks of a town, by having wires laid
down in the streets to connect them in one voltaic circuit. Such a
plan would, however, have involved greater expense and trouble in its
accomplishment than the object seemed to merit; but the regulation
of any number of clocks in a large establishment might have been
practicable by that means. We are not aware, however, that this mode
of regulating clocks by electricity was ever adopted, and it has since
been superseded by an arrangement made by Mr. Shepherd, junior, to be
presently noticed.

Improving on this first application of electro-magnetism to the
regulation of clocks, Mr. Bain afterwards employed the power to keep
the clocks in action, so that each clock might be propelled by magnets
alone, without any weight, and without the ordinary train of wheels.

Every one acquainted with the mechanism of a clock is aware that the
weight communicates motion to a train of wheels, and that the movement
is regulated by the vibration of a pendulum, which is acted on by
the last wheel of the train. That wheel, called the escapement, is
so formed, that each tooth catches in succession into a detent fixed
on the pendulum near the point of suspension, which allows one tooth
to pass at each double vibration. The pendulum, therefore, governs
the movement of the train of wheels by checking the escapement, and
allowing the teeth to pass one by one; and as pendulums of given
lengths vibrate in given times, if their actions be not interfered
with, the clocks will keep regular time. But the pressure of the
escape-wheel against the detent, and the consequent friction, prevent
the pendulum from acting freely. In the best made clocks there are
special contrivances to detach the pendulum as much as possible from
the wheels, and likewise to compensate for variations in the length of
the pendulum by change of temperature.

In the clocks actuated by electro-magnetism, the movement of the
pendulum is not maintained by repeated impulses of the escape-wheel, as
in ordinary clocks, but by magnetic attraction; an electro-magnet being
so arranged as to attract the bob of the pendulum in both directions
alternately. In Mr. Bain's arrangement, the bob of the pendulum
is formed of a hollow coil of covered copper wire, which, on the
transmission of an electric current, becomes magnetic, and it is then
attracted by several permanent magnets fixed in a hollow horizontal
bar, over which the coil of wire moves. The accompanying diagram will
serve to explain more clearly the parts of the clock on which the
movement of the pendulum depends.

The pendulum rod, _B_, is made of wood, and the bob, _A_, consists of a
hollow coil of thick copper wire covered with cotton, through which the
hollow bar, _C C_, passes. Inside that bar there are several permanent
magnets, packed on each side of the ends of the coil of wire, the poles
of those on one side being the opposite of those on the other. In the
diagram only one magnet on each side is represented, _n_ and _s_, to
prevent confusion. The ends of the coil of wire are attached to the
pendulum rod, and they are conducted up it so as to form connection
with the wires of the voltaic battery, which are connected with gold
studs inserted into a horizontal stage fixed to the clock-case. A small
movable bridge, formed of wire, and having the ends tipped with gold or
platinum, rests upon the stage, and is shifted from side to side by the
pendulum. In these movements the gold points touch and slide over the
gold studs in the stage, and thereby make and break contact with the
voltaic battery, and alternately send and interrupt an electric current
through the coil of wire.

[Illustration]

Suppose, for instance, that the pendulum is about to rise to the right
towards _s_, at which time the voltaic circuit is completed. The coil
is, therefore, magnetic, and is attracted by the permanent magnet in
_C_. As the pendulum approaches the end of its swing, it pushes the
movable bridge away from the gold studs on which it rests, and thus
breaks connection with the voltaic battery, and the pendulum descends
unrestrained by the attractive force of the magnets. As the pendulum
descends towards its lowest point, it shifts the bridge on to the metal
studs on the other side, which are so disposed as to send a current
through the coil in a direction opposite to the former, so that the
poles of the voltaic battery are reversed, and the attractive force
is exerted in drawing the pendulum towards the left hand. In this
manner the power imparted to the coil, as the pendulum vibrates to and
fro, produces a continuous repetition of the attraction on each side
alternately, and maintains a constant action.

The only wheels required in a clock of this kind are those which turn
the hands; and the motion is communicated from the pendulum to the
seconds wheel by means of a small attached lever, working on a ratchet
wheel. The minute and the hour hands derive their movements from the
seconds wheel in the usual manner.

The voltaic battery employed to work Mr. Bain's clocks consists of a
pair of large copper and zinc plates buried in the moist earth, which
excite a sufficient amount of electricity to maintain the motion of the
pendulum. A battery of this kind will remain in action a long time, and
will serve to keep a clock going for several months. It is, indeed, a
near approach to the attainment of perpetual motion, since nothing but
the wearing away of the materials, or the accumulation of dust on the
connecting points, seems to prevent the realization of that mechanical
chimera.

There is a disadvantage attending the arrangement of Mr. Bain's
clocks, arising from the attachment of the pendulum to the wheels;
and as the moving force is derived directly from voltaic electricity,
any variation in the power of the battery causes variation in the
lengths of the vibrations, and produces irregularity. For the purpose
of remedying these defects, Mr. Shepherd, junior, has adopted an
arrangement which detaches the pendulum from the clock movement, and
makes its vibrations altogether independent of the varying force of
voltaic batteries.

In Mr. Shepherd's arrangement, the impulse of the pendulum is given
by successive blows from a spring, which is drawn back and then
liberated at each vibration. The hands of the clock are also moved
by electro-magnets, by which means the impelling forces and the
resistances encountered by the pendulum are always constant. By making
the pendulum thus independent of the works, and employing it merely to
make and break contract at regular intervals, any number of clocks in
the same establishment may be set in motion, and kept exactly together,
by a single pendulum.

The large clock over the principal entrance to the Great Exhibition was
on this construction. It would have been impossible, with any approach
to regularity, to have moved hands of that size, exposed as they
were to the wind, unless the pendulum had been independent of such
resistances.

Electro-Magnetic Clocks have not yet come into general use, partly
owing to imperfections in the battery connections, which occasionally
put a stop to their movements, but principally on account of the high
prices charged by the patentees. As no trains of wheels are requisite
in an Electro-Magnetic Clock, it might be manufactured very cheaply;
and when the price is reduced to its proper standard, and the trifling
practical defects are remedied, these clocks may possibly supersede
others.




ELECTRO-METALLURGY.


The electrotype, electro-gilding and plating, and the other
applications of the deposition of metals from their solutions, by
the agency of voltaic electricity, had their origin in the chance
observation of peculiarities in frequently repeated experiments. In
this, as in most other inventions, there are contending claimants for
priority; but there is little merit due to any of the first discoverers
of the process, who seem to have been guided altogether by accident. It
seems strange, now, on observing the extensive use that is made of the
deposition of metals, that it should have remained so long unapplied
after the principle had been known.

The "revivification," as it was called, of metals from their solutions
by voltaic electricity, was known at the beginning of the present
century; for, in 1805, Brugnatelli, an Italian chemist, gilded a silver
medal by connecting it with the negative pole of a voltaic battery,
when immersed in a solution of ammoniuret of gold. It did not occur to
him, however, that any use could be made of that mode of gilding, and
the experiment had no result.

Nothing further was done, even experimentally, towards advancing
the art of electrotyping, until Mr. Spencer, of Liverpool, when
experimenting with a Daniell's battery, in 1837, accidentally coated a
penny piece with copper; and when the thin sheet of metal was removed,
he found on it an exact counterpart of the head and letters of the
coin. Even this did not suggest any useful application; nor was it
until, by a further accident, a drop of varnish fell on the copper of
the negative pole, and showed that no deposition took place on the part
so covered, that the idea occurred to him of turning the deposition of
the copper to account. The method he adopted of doing so was to cover
a copper plate with varnish or wax, and to etch a design through the
covering. By then exposing the plate to the action of a solution of
sulphate of copper, when in connection with the negative pole of a
voltaic battery, the metal was deposited in the lines drawn through the
varnish, and a design in relief was fixed to the copper. This slight
advance in the art was not made known until it was announced, in 1839,
that Professor Jacobi, of St. Petersburg, had made application of
the same process. Mr. Spencer, indeed, was forestalled, even in this
country, by Mr. Jordan, a printer, who published an account in the
_Mechanics' Magazine_ for May, 1839, of a method of making copper casts
by the deposition of copper from its solution. In the autumn of the
same year, however, Mr. Spencer exhibited to the British Association
several more perfect specimens of electrotyping, that showed the
process might be rendered valuable; and from that time rapid progress
was made in bringing it into practical operation in a variety of ways.

The deposition of copper from its solution, when under the action
of voltaic electricity, is not produced by the decomposition of the
sulphate of copper, as might be supposed, but by the decomposition of
the water that acts as the solvent of the metallic salt. Thus, when
two platinum wires from the poles of a voltaic battery are introduced
into acidulated water, hydrogen gas is disengaged at the wire connected
with the negative pole, and oxygen at the other; but when a solution
of sulphate of copper is substituted for water, the hydrogen that is
disengaged combines with the oxygen that held the copper in solution,
and the metal is liberated. The copper thus liberated from its
combination with the oxygen is deposited, in a pure metallic state, on
the surface connected with the negative pole of the battery.

The simplest illustration of electro-metallic deposition is obtained
by immersing a silver spoon and a strip of zinc into a solution of
sulphate of copper. So long as the two metals are kept apart, no change
takes place on the silver, but on bringing them into contact, voltaic
action immediately commences, and a coating of copper is deposited
upon the spoon, and adheres firmly to the metal. If the action be
continued, and the supply of copper be maintained by the addition of
fresh crystals of the sulphate, the coat of copper may be increased in
thickness to almost any extent.

The first applications of the discovery were directed to the copying
of medals and coins. An impression of the metal was obtained in fusible
metal, which is an alloy composed of tin, lead, and bismuth, melted
together in the proportions of two of the latter to one each of the
former. This alloy expands on cooling, and thus affords a very sharp
impression of the medals; and as it melts at a low temperature, it may
be easily removed after the copper coating has been deposited upon it.

An electrotype mould, obtained directly from the medal, is, however,
more sharp in its definition than an impression, and is therefore
preferable, when circumstances admit of its being so taken. For that
purpose, the surface whereon the deposition is to be made is smeared
over with sweet oil, or with black lead. It is then carefully wiped
with cotton wool, but a minute quantity of the oil will still remain,
sufficient to prevent the metal from adhering.

A simple form of apparatus for the electrotype process is shown in the
accompanying diagram.

An earthenware jar, _a_, serves to hold the solution of copper, which
should be maintained in a saturated state by the addition of crystals
of the salt. A porous tube, _b_, holds a rod of amalgamated zinc, to
the top of which a binding-screw is soldered. The copper mould or
medal, _c_, is suspended in the solution by a wire, which is held
tight by the binding-screw, _d_. The porous jar is then filled to the
same height as the copper solution in the jar with diluted sulphuric
acid, in the proportions of one of acid to twenty of water. Voltaic
action immediately commences, and the copper will continue to be
deposited from the solution as long as the supply of fresh crystals
of sulphate of copper is continued. In about twenty-four hours the
coating of copper will be as thick as a thin card, and it may be then
removed. When detached from the medal, it will be found to be an exact
counterpart, in the minutest details, of the original; those parts of
the medal which are in relief being, of course, the reverse in the
mould.

[Illustration]

The extreme minuteness and delicacy of the electrotype process is
strikingly exemplified in its application to the transference of
engraved copper-plates. A highly finished engraved copper-plate
has a film of metal deposited over its whole surface, which, when
detached, exhibits all the lines that are cut into the copper-plate
in relief. That electrotype cast then serves as the mould for further
depositions, in which every line in the original engraving is so
perfectly developed, that it is impossible to detect a difference
in the impressions taken from the two plates. By this means any
number of casts may be made and worked from, whilst the original is
preserved uninjured. The objection to this application is that the
metal deposited is not so hard as the hammered plates, and will not,
therefore, bear the wear and tear of copper-plate printing so well as
the plates made by hand.

It was at one time supposed that the depositing of metal on surfaces,
by voltaic action, might be applied to the manufacture of numerous
kinds of copper articles without manual labour. For this purpose, casts
were made of plaster of Paris, which were covered with black lead,
to give them the property of conducting electricity, and the metal
was then deposited upon them. But, independently of the practical
difficulties attending the operation, it was found that the metal was
not sufficiently hard, and the cost of the requisite voltaic batteries
rendered the economy of the process questionable.

One of the successful applications of Electro-Metallurgy is founded
on the original application of it by Mr. Spencer. As already stated,
he covered metal plates with wax, and after scratching through the
coating, and exposing the metal, he submitted the plate to voltaic
action in a solution of sulphate of copper, and thus obtained a
representation, in relief, of the figures cut through the wax; but
he does not seem to have thought of the application of this mode of
deposition, since adopted, by which engravings in relief are obtained,
and printed from with the ordinary letter-press, in the same manner as
woodcuts. The name given to this new art is "Glyphography," and it is
used with great advantage when the effect of copper-plate engraving
is required; for cross lines, which are difficult to cut in wood, can
be worked by this method with as great facility as in copper-plate
etching.

Another application of Electro-Metallurgy that promises to be useful,
is the coating of glass and earthenware vessels with copper, so as to
enable them to be placed over the fire without being cracked. A glass
sauce-pan might thus be made, which, protected by metal covering,
would neither break nor crack when placed upon the fire, because the
metal would diffuse the heat over the whole surface, and prevent the
unequal expansion of the vessel, which is the cause of the cracking of
glass and earthenware when placed upon the fire. A patent was granted
last year for a mode of coating earthenware vessels with copper or
iron by electro-chemical deposition. The earthenware is first covered
either with copper leaf or with bronze powder, to obtain an electrical
conducting surface on which the copper can be deposited, and the
vessel is then placed in a solution of sulphate of copper, and put in
connection with the negative pole of a voltaic battery.

The electrotype is frequently applied with advantage to the
preservation and multiplication of objects of art and natural
productions, for even the forms of flowers may be in this manner
rendered durable; but the most important use that has been made of
the process is in plating and gilding. To effect that object, it is
necessary to employ a voltaic battery separated from the vessel in
which the decomposition takes place. The annexed diagram shows an
arrangement of this kind. A single cell of a Daniell's battery, _a_,
is connected by wires from its positive and negative poles, with metal
rods placed across the decomposition cell, _b_. The articles to be
plated are suspended by wires from the metal rod, _f_, and a plate of
silver is attached to the rod, _e_. Thus, when the vessel is filled
with the silvering liquid, a voltaic current is established, and the
deposition is effected on the articles connected with the negative pole.

[Illustration]

The menstruum best adapted for electro-plating is a solution of silver
in cyanide of potassium. During the process of deposition, the same
quantity of metal that is deposited from the liquid on the objects
connected with the negative pole of the battery is restored to it, by
dissolving an equal quantity from the silver plate connected with the
positive pole, and in this manner the solution is maintained at the
same strength. Any thickness of silver may be deposited by continuing
the process, but about one ounce and a half to a square foot of
surface is considered a full quantity. Those parts on which no silver
is required to be deposited are covered with varnish or wax, which
protects them from the voltaic action.

Where the operation of electro-plating is carried on extensively,
decomposing troughs, holding nearly 300 gallons, are employed, and the
silver plates in a single trough expose a surface of thirty square feet
to the dissolving action of the menstruum under the influence of the
voltaic battery.

By the aid of electro-plating the most elaborate designs of the artist
in metal can be covered with silver on every part; and a group, finely
engraved in copper, may be made to resemble in every particular a work
cut out of solid silver. The metal is usually deposited in a granulated
state, resembling "frosted" silver, and the parts required to be bright
are subsequently burnished; but by the addition of a few drops of the
sulphuret of carbon to the solution, the silver may be precipitated
perfectly bright.




GAS LIGHTING.


The invention of Gas Lighting had its origin in the earliest times of
history; not, indeed, as we now see it, burning at the end of a pipe
supplied with gas made artificially, and stored in gas-holders, but
blazing from fissures in the ground, supplied from natural sources in
the bowels of the earth. The Greek fire-altars are supposed to have
been supplied with gas, either issuing from bituminous beds, or made
artificially by the priests, by pouring oil on heated stones placed
in cavities beneath. Fountains of naphtha, and fires issuing from the
earth at Ecbatana, in Media, are mentioned by Plutarch in his life of
Alexander, and many other ancient historians record the knowledge of
similar instances of natural gas lighting.

In later times, the inflammable gas issuing into the galleries of coal
mines, and either exploding when mixed with atmospheric air, or blazing
as it issued from fissures in the coal, afforded instances of the
natural production of gas, the ignition of which too frequently proved
fatal to those in the mines.

A remarkable instance of the issue of inflammable gas into the shaft of
a coal mine at Whitehaven, which produced a blaze about 3 feet diameter
and 6 feet long, is noticed in the "Philosophical Transactions" of
1733. The part whence the gas issued was vaulted off, and a tube was
inserted into the cavity and carried to the top of the pit, where it
escaped in undiminished quantity for years, and lighted the country for
a distance of several miles. Many experiments were made with this large
issue of gas, and it was proposed to conduct it in pipes to Whitehaven,
to light the streets of that town, but the proposition was rejected by
the local authorities.

In China, naturally produced gas is used on a large scale, and was so
long before the knowledge of its application was acquired by Europeans.
Beds of coal, lying at a great depth, are frequently pierced by the
borers for salt water, and from these wells the inflammable gas springs
up. It sometimes appears as a jet of fire from 20 to 30 feet high; and,
in the neighbourhood of Thsee-Lieon-Teing, the salt works were formerly
heated and lighted by means of these fountains of fire. Bamboo pipes
carry the gas from the spring to the places where it is intended to be
consumed. These canes are terminated by tubes of pipe-clay, to prevent
their being burnt, and other bamboo canes conduct the gas intended
for lighting the streets, and into large apartments and kitchens.
Thus Nature presents in these positions a complete establishment of
gas-light works.[9]

Though the production of illuminating gas from natural sources had
been thus long known, the idea of distilling it artificially from
coal, for the purpose of illumination, did not occur until the end of
the last century. Dr. Clayton, indeed, nearly arrived at the practical
application of carburretted hydrogen, in 1737, for he instituted
experiments to prove that coal contains gas, nearly similar to that of
the "fire damp" in coal mines, and that it burns with a bright flame.
At that time, however, the nature of gases was so imperfectly known,
that he was unable to do more than discover that coal possesses the
property of giving out, when heated, gas that will burn with a bright
light.

In the "Philosophical Transactions" of 1739, Dr. Clayton thus
describes the effect of the "spirit of coal," obtained by destructive
distillation in an iron retort. "I kept this spirit," he says, "in
bladders for a considerable time, and endeavoured several ways to
condense it, but in vain; and when I had a mind to divert strangers or
friends, I have frequently taken one of these bladders, and pierced
a hole in it with a pin, and, compressing gently the bladder near
the flame of a candle till it once took fire, it would then continue
flaming till all the spirit was compressed out of the bladder; which
was the more surprising, because no one could discern any difference in
the appearance between these bladders and those which were filled with
common air."

The first known application of coal gas to illumination was made, in
1792, by Mr. William Murdoch, engineer at the Soho manufactory, to
whose great ingenuity the world is also indebted for the invention of
the first plan of a steam locomotive engine.[10] He was at that time
occupied in superintending the fitting up of steam engines for the
Cornish mines, and his attention having been directed to the properties
of gas issuing from coal, he instituted a series of experiments on
carburretted hydrogen, the practical result of which was the lighting
of his house and offices, at Redruth, with coal gas. The mines at which
Mr. Murdoch worked being some miles distant from his house, he was in
the constant practice of filling a bladder with coal gas, in the neck
of which he fixed a metallic tube with a small orifice, through which
the gas issued. The lighted gas issuing through the tube served as a
lantern to light his way; and as he thus proceeded along the road with
the light issuing from the bladder, the country people looked upon him
as a wizard.

The gas was generated by Mr. Murdoch in an iron retort, and collected
in a common gasometer, from which it was conducted in pipes to the
rooms to be lighted. He also, in an early stage of the invention,
contrived a means for making the gas portable, by compressing it into
strong vessels; a plan which, a few years since, was adopted by the
Portable Gas Company in London.

Mr. Murdoch having proved the practicability of illumination by gas
generated from coal, he continued his experiments to facilitate the
manufacture of the gas on a large scale, and for its more perfect
purification. The first public display of its illuminating power was
made at the rejoicings for the peace of Amiens, in 1802, on which
occasion part of the work-shops of Messrs. Boulton and Watt, at Soho,
was brilliantly illuminated with coal gas by Mr. Murdoch. In 1805,
Messrs. Phillips and Lee, of Manchester, had their extensive cotton
mill fitted up with gas apparatus, under the superintendence of Mr.
Murdoch, and the quantity of light given out by the burners in all
parts of the cotton mill was equal to that of 3,000 candles.[11]

Notwithstanding these eminently successful trials of gas lighting,
the prejudice against innovation prevented, for several years, the
extensive adoption of the plan. As every establishment using gas had
to make it, and as the apparatus was costly and imperfectly managed,
the expense in the first instance, the trouble, and the noxious
smell, presented great obstacles to the introduction of that mode of
illumination. The popular notion, also, that streams of flame were
rushing along the pipes produced an impression that gas lighting must
be very dangerous, which it required time to disprove. It was not,
therefore, till several years after the advantages and economy of gas
had been practically established, that a public company was formed
for laying down pipes to light the streets, and to convey the gas into
houses for lighting shops.

The person to whom the world is chiefly indebted for the practical
application of gas lighting is Mr. Winsor, who had been a merchant in
London. Being very sanguine as to the advantages to be derived from
gas lighting, and possessing an ardent temperament which no opposition
could quench, he undertook to introduce it to public notice, and to
form a company for lighting the whole of England with gas. He hired
the old Lyceum Theatre, which he lighted with coal gas, and he there
delivered lectures and exhibited experiments to show the benefits that
would arise from the universal use of gas light, and coke fuel. He
published an extravagant prospectus of a company to be formed, with the
following title:--"A National Light and Heat Company, for providing our
streets and houses with light and heat, on similar principles as they
are now (1816) supplied with water. Demonstrated by the patentee at No.
97, Pall Mall, where it is proved, by positive experiments and decisive
calculation, that the destruction of smoke would open unto the empire
of Great Britain new and unparalleled sources of inexhaustible wealth
at this most portentous crisis of Europe. The serious perusal of this
publication, and an attentive observation of the decisive experiments,
will carry conviction to every mind."

In this prospectus Mr. Winsor attempted to make it appear that by
adopting his plan there would be "a grand balance of profit for the
whole realm of £115,000,000," and each shareholder of the company was
promised, "at the lowest calculation, £570 for every £5 deposit." He
entertained the notion of making the use of gas and coke compulsory, by
levying a tax on all who obstinately refused to adopt what would be so
much to their own advantage. This tax, he said, "cannot be oppressive
in the least, because it falls on the obstinate only, who shall resist
the use of a far superior, cheaper, and safer fuel." Not content with
the language of prose, Mr. Winsor vented his thoughts and feelings in
numerous poetical effusions. The flights of his Muse, however, were not
into the regions of sublimity, as may be perceived by the following
specimen:--

      "Must Britons be condemned for ever to wallow
      In filthy soot, noxious smoke, train oil, and tallow,
      And their poisonous fumes for ever to swallow?
      For with sparky soot, snuffs and vapours, men have constant
              strife,--
      Those who are not burned to death are smothered during life."

Mr. Winsor's absurd statements--in the truth of which he potently
believed--and the wild, random manner of making them known, excited
much ridicule and opposition. Among his opponents was Mr. Nicholson,
the editor of the _Chemical Review_, who not only challenged Mr.
Winsor's estimates, but the validity of his patent, on the ground
that Mr. Murdoch was the original inventor. Mr. Winsor's plans and
calculations were burlesqued in a cleverly written "Heroic Poem,"
published in a quarto volume, which, whilst professing to extol the
virtues of gas and coke, quizzed its hero most unmercifully. The poem
concluded with this address:--

      "And when, ah, Winsor!--distant be the day!--
      Life's flame no longer shall ignite thy clay,
      Thy phosphur nature, active still, and bright,
      Above us shall diffuse _post obit_ light.
      Perhaps, translated to another sphere,
      Thy spirit--like thy light, refined and clear--
      Ballooned with purest hydrogen, shall rise,
      And add a PATENT PLANET to the skies.
      Then some sage Sidrophel, with Herschel eye,
      The bright _Winsorium Sidus_ shall descry;
      The _Vox Stellarum_ shall record thy name,
      And thine outlive another Winsor's fame."

"Though we may smile at Mr. Winsor's extravagant plans and
calculations," observes the _Journal of Gas Lighting_, "we cannot but
admire the enthusiasm with which he pursued his object, and ultimately
succeeded in establishing the first gas company. The lighting of Pall
Mall with gas, in the spring of 1807, gave increased stimulus to the
project, and application was made to Parliament to carry it into
effect. The bill was opposed by Mr. Murdoch and thrown out; but in
the following year (1810) the application was successfully renewed.
The scheme, however, as sanctioned by Parliament, was sadly shorn
of its magnificent proportions; and, instead of a 'Grand National
Light and Heat Company, for Lighting and Heating the Whole Kingdom,'
its operations were limited to London, Westminster, and Southwark;
nor were any special taxes imposed on those who should obstinately
refuse to use the light and burn the coke. The Chartered Gas Company,
established by Mr. Winsor's persevering efforts, has served as the
guiding star to all other gas companies in the world."

The illuminating property of coal gas depends on the quantity of carbon
it contains. Pure hydrogen gas burns with a pale blue flame that gives
scarcely any light, though it possesses intense heating power. If,
however, minute particles of a solid body--powdered charcoal, for
instance--be thrown into the flame, they become white-hot, and the
incandescence of those solid particles produces a brilliant light. The
same effect is caused by the combustion of the carburretted hydrogen
gas, and in a more perfect manner. That gas contains a large portion
of carbon in a state of vapour, and when a light is applied to a jet
of the gas the hydrogen immediately inflames, the carbon is deposited
in the flame, and the minute particles into which it is disseminated
become highly heated and ignite.

There are two distinct states of carbonization in illuminating gas.
The commoner kind--the ordinary coal gas--consists of two measures
of hydrogen mixed with one measure of carbon vapour. The specific
gravity of such gas is about one-half that of atmospheric air, and
it is eight times heavier than pure hydrogen.[12] The best kind of
gas for illumination is obtained from the distillation of oil. It is
called olefiant gas, and contains equal measures of hydrogen gas and
carbon vapour; its specific gravity is 0.985, being about fifteen times
heavier than pure hydrogen.

The _rationale_ of the process of making coal gas consists in expelling
the volatile matters from the coal by heat, in closed vessels or
retorts, and then separating the gas and purifying it on its passage
from the retort to the gas-holder, where it is stored for use.

The retorts are usually made of cast iron, and are about 7 feet long,
14 inches in depth, and the same in width; the shape being that of
an arch. The retorts will hold two hundredweight of coal each, but
they are never filled, because during the process of distillation the
carbonaceous part of the coal expands, and occupies more space than
the original quantity, the proportion of expansion being as one and a
quarter to one. There is a large aperture for the admission of coal
and the extraction of coke, which aperture is covered with a lid, and
screwed to make it air-tight. A tube is inserted into the mouth of the
retort, to carry off the products of the distillation. That tube rises
about twelve feet, and then dips into a large horizontal pipe, one foot
in diameter, called the hydraulic main, in which are collected the
tar and ammoniacal liquor that distil from the coal. Ten or fourteen
retorts are usually set back to back in brickwork, to be heated by one
fire; but the plan has been recently introduced of employing long clay
retorts, which are charged at both ends. These are found to possess
considerable advantage over iron, not only from their lower price, but
from the facility with which the carbonaceous deposit is removed, and
the full charges worked off. Coke is generally burned in the furnaces,
and the heat is continually maintained so as to keep the retorts
red-hot.

As atmospheric air cannot gain access to the coal in the retorts, the
gases expelled do not inflame, nor can the parts that are not volatile
be consumed without a supply of air. It is entirely a process of
distillation, in which all the products can be collected. The volatile
parts are carried off by the pipe, and the solid carbonaceous matter,
or coke, is left in the retort.

The first effect of heat on coal, after it is put into the retort,
is to expel the moisture, which, in combination with the air, issues
in the form of steam. Tar then distils, with some portions of gas,
consisting of hydrogen and ammonia. When the retort has attained a
bright cherry-red heat, the disengagement of the carburretted hydrogen
is most active; and it is found that the more quickly the coal is
heated, the greater is the quantity of illuminating gas generated.

The production of coal gas, and the development of its properties at
different stages of distillation, may be readily shown by means of
a common tobacco pipe. Fill the bowl of the pipe with small pieces
of coal, cover it over with a lump of clay, and then put it into a
hot fire, with the stalk of the pipe projecting through the bars.
Presently steam will be seen to issue from the pipe, and afterwards
smoke, and, if a light be applied, a jet of flame will issue forth, the
brilliancy of which will increase as the bowl of the pipe becomes more
heated, until the best part of the gas has been distilled from the coal.

The gas is mingled with various volatile products as it issues from
the retort, and requires to be purified before it is fitted for
illumination. The most abundant matter that passes over with it is tar.
The vapour of that substance, however, condenses when cooled, and it
may thus be separated from the gas very effectually. For that purpose
the gas, after having deposited a large portion of the tar in the
hydraulic main, is made to traverse through a number of vertical pipes,
and in passing through them a further quantity of tar, accompanied by
ammoniacal liquor, is deposited, and collected in a reservoir at the
bottom. The next process is the purification of the gas from carbonic
acid and sulphuretted hydrogen. This is commonly done by passing it
through water and lime; the combination of the carbonic acid with the
lime being facilitated by agitation. The method of purifying by lime
was introduced by Mr. Clegg; and by a later process, oxide of iron is
used to absorb the sulphuretted hydrogen. The gas, when purified, is
conveyed to the gas-holder, whence it is forced by pressure into the
mains and pipes.

An apparatus for generating coal gas on a small scale for private
establishments, remote from sources of ordinary supply, is represented
in the accompanying woodcut. The retort, A, is fitted in a small
furnace. The coal is put in at F, and the products of distillation pass
through the bent pipe, E. The more liquid portions of the tar pass at
once through the tube, B, into the receiver, G; and as the gas passes
along the bent tube, C, it becomes cooled, and a further deposit of tar
