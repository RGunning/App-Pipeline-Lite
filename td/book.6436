and ammoniacal liquor is made. The gas is then conveyed along another
tube into the purifier, H, filled with lime and water, and it thence
passes into the gas-holder. Tubes are inserted into the latter for
conveying the gas to the burners.

[Illustration]

The quantity and the quality of the gas yielded by coal differ
materially according to the kind employed. One ton of good Newcastle
coal will yield 9,500 cubic feet of gas, which, when burnt in the
best manner, gives a light equal to that of 422 lbs. of spermaceti
candles. One ton of Wigan cannel coal yields 10,000 cubic feet, and
gives a light equal to 747 lbs. of spermaceti candles.[13] The price,
in London, of good gas from Newcastle coal, is 4s. 6d. per thousand
cubic feet, which gives a light equal to 74½ lbs. of spermaceti, and
equal to 89 lbs. of mould candles; therefore, when the latter are 8d.
a pound, the burning of gas is twelve times more economical than the
burning of candles. In Liverpool, gas from cannel coal is supplied at
the low price of 3s. 9d. per thousand feet; and that gas gives at least
one-third more light than the ordinary London gas.

The cleanliness of gas, as compared with candles or oil, is a
further recommendation; and for the purpose of lighting streets,
shops, factories, public buildings, and halls, it presents important
advantages; but it is not well adapted for small sitting rooms, because
the heat of the flame makes it unpleasant and injurious to the eyes
when near, and, unless very pure, it deteriorates the air of closed
apartments. In many parts of the country, however, where coals are
cheap, and the price of gas is consequently less than in London, it is
introduced into every room of nearly all private houses.

The best kind of gas made from mineral substances is produced by the
distillation of a bituminous shale, called Boghead coal, which was
discovered a few years since in Scotland. One ton of this material
yields 15,000 cubic feet of gas, which is equal in illuminating power
to 1,930 lbs. of sperm candles. Boghead coal is now commonly used
for mixing its gas with that of inferior quality, to bring up the
illuminating power to the required standard.

Olefiant gas, made from oil, burns with a brighter and purer light
than common coal gas, but it is more costly. It is made nearly in the
same manner, by distillation in retorts; the principal difference
consisting in the degree and regulation of the temperature. A dull red
heat is the best, and in order to keep the oil exposed to the action
of an invariable heat, it is admitted gradually into the retorts, into
which pieces of brick or coke are inserted to increase the heating
surface. One pound of common oil yields about 15 feet of olefiant gas.
The same kind of gas may also be obtained in smaller quantities by the
distillation of tar, rosin, or pitch. Twelve cubic feet of gas may be
obtained from one pound of tar, and ten from the same weight of rosin.

The brilliancy of gas-light depends, in some measure, on the kind of
burner employed. To obtain a steady light, an argand burner is usually
adopted; the gas being allowed to escape through a number of minute
holes pierced in a hollow ring of metal, which admits a current of
air through the middle. To increase the supply of air, the burner is
covered with a glass chimney, which, if not too long, adds to the
brilliancy of the flame; but a very long chimney produces so strong a
current of air, as to cool the flame, and diminish the light. A plan
is sometimes adopted of placing a small metal disc a short distance
above the jets, so as to spread the flame. By this means the brightness
is increased, by exposing the flame more directly to the current of
air; and the metal disc, by becoming heated, also tends to aid the
combustion of the carbon.

One of the problems to be solved on the original formation of gas works
was the size of pipes, and the amount of pressure required to force the
gas to the various burners. It was at first supposed that the friction
against the pipes would oppose so much resistance to the passage of the
gas, that it could not be transmitted to great distances. It was found,
however, that the perpendicular pressure of a few inches of water was
quite sufficient to force the gas through the mains and small pipes of
an extensive range of streets. A bold attempt was made at Birmingham,
in 1826, to bring gas from the collieries, at a distance of ten miles
from the town. The plan was laughed at by many as impracticable, but it
was attended with complete success. The gas being made near the mouth
of the coal-pit, the cost of conveyance was saved by the additional
outlay in the first instance. It must be observed, however, that it
is extremely difficult in practice to avoid the escape of gas at the
junctions of the pipes; and by increasing the length of the gas mains,
the greater will be the leakage. The loss from this cause, in some gas
works, exceeds 20 per cent. of the gas manufactured.

The volume of gas discharged from a pipe is directly proportional to
the square of its diameter, and inversely as the square of its length.
Thus, if a pipe required to discharge 250 cubic feet of gas in an hour,
at a distance of 200 feet, must have an internal diameter of 1 inch;
to discharge 2,000 feet in an hour, at a distance of 1,000 feet, would
require a diameter of 4·47 inches. The same quantity discharged at
double the distance would require a pipe 5·32 inches in diameter; at a
distance of 4,000 feet the diameter must be increased to 6·13 inches;
and at a distance of 6,000 feet the diameter should be 7 inches.

On the first introduction of gas-light, the companies who supplied
it charged a fixed sum for each burner of a given size. This mode of
charging was, however, very unsatisfactory, for the size of the burner
is a very uncertain indication of the quantity of gas consumed. Persons
using gas desired to pay for the quantity they actually burned; and
to enable them to do this, a special contrivance was invented by Mr.
Clegg, the engineer of the Chartered Gas Company, called a gas-meter.
That instrument measures, with sufficient accuracy for practical
purposes, the volume of gas that passes through it to the burners, and
thus each consumer of gas now pays only for the number of cubic feet
consumed.

The accompanying diagrams represent sections of a gas meter, as seen
in front and edgewise. The outer case of the instrument, which is a
flat cylinder made of sheet iron, is indicated by the letters _c_, _c_.
Inside it there revolves another cylinder, made also of thin sheet
iron, and divided into four compartments, marked _d_, _d_, _d_, _d_.
This interior cylinder readily revolves on an axis, _g_, _g_, shown in
the section of the instrument as seen edgewise. The gas enters from
the street pipe through the opening, _a_, and it is forced out to the
burners through the pipe, _b_, the latter being seen in the narrow
section only. In that diagram, also, there is shown a cog-wheel, _h_,
fixed on to the axis, and a small outer case, in which that wheel
rotates. Water is poured into that external case until the gas-meter is
rather more than half filled, the level of the water being shown at _i_.

[Illustration]

The action of the instrument will be readily understood by examining
the two sections. The gas, on entering the tube, _a_, presses against
the upper surface of the compartment that happens to be then above it,
and tends to turn the inner cylinder round. This pressure forces the
gas through the opening, _b_, to the burner; and as the compartment
then in communication with that opening is emptied of the gas it
contains, in the direction of the arrow, it is gradually forced under
the level of the water, and the other compartment, which has in the
meantime been filling with gas, continues the supply. Thus, supposing
each division of the inner revolving cylinder to hold 108 cubic
inches, a complete revolution would indicate that the fourth part of a
cubic foot had passed through the pipe, _b_, to the burners. Several
cog-wheels, arranged like clock-work mechanism, are connected with
the wheel, _g_, and by this means the number of cubic feet of gas
consumed is indicated by hands fixed to the wheels, and pointing to the
corresponding figures on a series of dials.

Some inconvenience and irregularity having been experienced in the
use of the wet meter, the correctness of which, it is evident, may be
affected by variations in the height of the water level, dry meters
have been constructed for measuring gas, by causing it to pass through
a small expanding chamber, similar in principle to a pair of bellows.
The objection to these instruments is that the leather, or other
flexible substance that forms the sides of the expanding chambers,
becomes rigid by use, and the valves are liable to get out of order;
but in the last improvement of the instrument, by Mr. Croll, these
objections are stated to be effectually removed.

Numerous attempts have been made to produce illuminating gas from other
substances than coal, but without advantage. The plan that promised the
most success was the production of hydrogen gas by the decomposition
of water, which was passed over heated coke in retorts, and by that
means the oxygen of the water, combined with the incandescent coke and
the hydrogen, was set free. The gas thus collected possessed little
illuminating power, but it was afterwards mixed with the rich gas from
cannel coal, and raised to the requisite illuminating standard. It was
found, however, in practice, that the compound gas thus formed was more
costly than ordinary coal gas, and the plan has been discontinued.
Another method of giving illuminating power to water gas was to
surround the flame with platinum gauze, which was rendered incandescent
by the heat, and became highly luminous. But it required twice the
quantity of gas burned in this manner to produce a light equal to that
of carburretted hydrogen, and the combustion of so much hydrogen gas
produced an amount of vapour and heat that were very unpleasant. That
mode of gas illumination, called the "Gillard light," from the name
of the inventor, was also found more costly than the ordinary mode of
lighting with coal gas, which has now no rival to compete with it in
economical illumination.

No Act of Parliament is now required, as originally proposed by
Mr. Winsor, to enforce the burning of coal gas. Its advantages, in
point of economy, cleanliness, and even of safety, are sufficiently
understood to spread the use of coal gas to every part of the kingdom.
In the metropolis alone there are twelve gas companies, who receive
for the sale of gas an average of £100,000 per annum each, thus making
the sum paid for gas lighting in London £1,200,000, and it has been
estimated as high as £2,000,000. Taking the average price to be 4s.
6d. per thousand cubic feet, the quantity of gas consumed amounts
to 5,300,000,000 cubic feet; and if we add to that quantity 20 per
cent. for leakage through the mains and pipes, the quantity of gas
manufactured in the metropolitian gas works is upwards of 6,000,000,000
cubic feet in a year. It may, perhaps, give a clearer notion of this
immense quantity to say, that a gas-holder, capable of containing it,
would require to be one mile in diameter, and the height of St. Paul's
Cathedral. The light produced by burning such a volume of gas would
be equal to that of 150,000 tons of mould candles, which would cost
£13,000,000. The quantity of coals requisite for the production of the
gas manufactured annually in London is upwards of 600,000 tons.




THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.


The Electric Light is the brightest meteor that has flashed across the
horizon of promise during the present century. When first exhibited
as a means of illumination, about twelve years ago, the splendour of
the rays emitted, and the delusive representations of the small cost
required to produce such a brilliant light, led the public to believe
that the career of gas-lighting was drawing to a close, and that night
would be turned into day by this wonderful demonstration of electrical
power. The light produced by charcoal points, subjected to the action
of a powerful voltaic battery, was, however, no novelty at that time;
for as far back as 1810, Sir Humphry Davy was accustomed to exhibit
that development of electrical force at the Royal Institution, and it
formed a standard experiment in most chemical lectures. But it seems
not to have been thought applicable in those days to the purposes of
illumination; and when Mr. Staite brought it into notice, and exhibited
its effects on the tops of some public buildings, it was considered one
of the most wonderful inventions of the age.

Mr. Staite's patent, taken out in 1847, though commonly supposed to
be for the Electric Light generally, was limited in its clauses to
the construction of a voltaic battery and apparatus, adapted for
maintaining constancy, and for giving steadiness to the light. The
merely temporary continuance of the _voltaic arc_, as it was formerly
called, seemed indeed to preclude the possibility of its adoption as a
means of illumination; it was therefore a great point gained to give
stability and constancy to the light. The difficulty of accomplishing
this will be perceived when it is known that the charcoal points,
between which the action takes place, are constantly undergoing change,
the particles of carbon being transferred from one to the other. There
is no actual combustion of the charcoal, in the ordinary meaning of
the term; the action is principally confined to the transfer of the
charcoal connected with the positive pole, to that connected with the
negative pole of the voltaic battery, a hollow being formed in one, and
a pyramidical accumulation of particles in the other. This action was
beautifully shown by Professor Faraday at the Royal Institution last
year, by projecting the image of the charcoal points on to a screen,
by means of the Electric Light itself. The image, magnified by the
lenses of the electric lamp, could thus be distinctly seen without
being too brilliant to dazzle the eyes. The particles of carbon, heated
to whiteness, were perceived to be in active motion, and the piling
up of the pyramid in one, and the hollow produced in the other, were
continually varying the distances between them, and thus tending to
cause unsteadiness in the light.

Numerous contrivances have been adopted for the purpose of keeping
the points at exactly the same distance, as the want of stability was
supposed to be the only obstacle to the adoption of the Electric Light.
These contrivances have so far succeeded, that a tolerably steady light
can be maintained for some time, but under the most careful management
the points occasionally approach too near or are too far apart to
maintain an equable light.

Among other inventions to increase the steadiness of the light is one
that was patented in 1856, by Mr. Way, in which mercury is substituted
for charcoal, but the steadiness of light to be thus acquired must
be attained with a great loss of illuminating power, and the vapour
arising from the combustion of the mercury would be extremely injurious
to health.

Mr. Hearder, of Plymouth, has produced more brilliant effects with the
Electric Light than any other person. Some remarkable exhibitions of
the power of the light were made by him, in April, 1849, from the top
of the Devonport Column, and several scientific gentlemen undertook to
make observations at different localities to a distance of five miles.
At Tremeton Castle, on the banks of the Tamar, a distance of nearly 3½
miles; the light cast a strong shadow, and writing could be distinctly
read by it. The space illuminated was at least three quarters of a
mile broad. To aid the effect, a reflector was employed, and when the
rays were directed to the clouds, they had the appearance of a huge
comet, the reflector being the nucleus. The intensity of the light was
ascertained to be equal to that of 301,400 mould candles of six to the
pound, whilst the light of the Breakwater Lighthouse was equal to only
150 candles. At a distance of five miles the light was sufficiently
powerful to enable persons to read a book.

The battery employed by Mr. Hearder in these brilliant experiments
consisted of 80 cells of a Maynooth battery, 4 inches square, and
the carbon cylinders between which the light appeared were formed of
powdered coke, mixed with tar, and rammed into a tube three quarters
of an inch in diameter. When these cylinders are about a quarter of
an inch apart, the Electric Light appears at the end of each for the
space of more than half an inch. The light, during the experiments at
Plymouth, was maintained for three hours, and the materials employed
amounted to one pound and a-half of zinc, 114 fluid ounces of sulphuric
acid, the same quantity of nitric acid, and six pounds of muriate of
ammonia.[14]

The most serious practical objection to the introduction of the
Electric Light, as a means of general illumination, is its expense.
When the project was first brought into notice, attempts were made to
show that the battery power required might be obtained at little cost,
and in this respect some deceptions were practised not creditable to
the parties engaged in promoting the scheme. It has been proved by Mr.
Grove that the cost of ordinary batteries necessary to maintain the
light in full brilliancy would greatly exceed the price of an equal
light from gas.

A plan was patented for generating the required voltaic power, free
from cost, by applying the residual sulphate of zinc as paint, and an
Electric Power and Light Company was formed to carry out the project.
But the plan failed, and the affairs of the company have recently been
"wound up."

Until some cheaper mode of generating electricity than is at present
known be invented, there is no hope of the Electric Light becoming
generally available, but there are special circumstances in which
it may be applied with advantage. It is peculiarly applicable for
lighthouses, as its rays would penetrate through a foggy atmosphere
that would obscure the light of ordinary flames, and in such cases the
extra cost should not operate as an obstacle to its use.




INSTANTANEOUS LIGHTS.


Those who are not old enough to remember the time when flint-and-steel
were the implements employed to obtain a light, can have no sufficient
appreciation of the great convenience of "Lucifer" matches. In those
"good old times," it was a regular household care to provide a
sufficiency of tinder, to see that it was kept dry, and that there
was a proper flint "with fire in it." The striking of a light, when
the tinder-box was adequately supplied, was no mean accomplishment;
and the unskilful hand, operating in the dark, would either get no
sparks at all, or send them in a wrong direction, and not unfrequently
strike the skin off the knuckles, in the vain endeavour to set light
to the tinder. Or if the tinder were damp, the sparks would fall upon
it without igniting, and minutes would be spent in holding a pointed
brimstone match to the delusive spark, and blowing at it without
effect. Sometimes the incautious operator, tired with his fruitless
efforts, would sprinkle gunpowder over the tinder, to make it take
fire more readily, and whilst puffing at a long-desired spark, the
gunpowder would explode in his face and nearly blind him. Such were
some of the annoyances, attended by loss of time, that were experienced
in obtaining the same result that is now produced instantaneously, and
much more effectively, by merely rubbing the match against any rough
surface.

Several attempts had, indeed, been made many years ago to supplant
the flint-and-steel and tinder-box, and some of the plans adopted so
closely approach the matches now in use, that we wonder the inventors
did not succeed long since in contriving the very facile means of
striking a light that we now enjoy. Phosphorus and brimstone matches
were first employed for the purpose. The phosphorus was contained in a
bottle placed within a tin case, which also held the pointed brimstone
matches and a piece of cork. The match was dipped into the phosphorus
bottle, and then rubbed on the cork; and the friction excited
sufficient heat to inflame the small quantity of phosphorus adhering
to the match and, to set fire to the sulphur. These phosphorus boxes
answered the purpose very well, but the apprehended danger of using so
inflammable a substance prevented their coming into general use; and
they were much more costly than a tinder-box.

In the next advance, if it may be so called, in the invention of
instantaneous light-producers, phosphorus was altogether discarded,
and a mixture of chlorate of potass, then called oxymuriate of potass,
and sugar was employed. Those substances, when combined, inflame
explosively in contact with sulphuric acid. In applying them for the
purpose of obtaining instantaneous light, they were mixed together in
an adhesive menstruum, into which the ends of small rectangular matches
were dipped. These matches very nearly resembled the "Lucifers" of
the present day. To ignite them, a small bottle containing sulphuric
acid and asbestos was provided, and they were arranged together in
an ornamental taper-stand for the chimney-piece. This apparatus was
not received with much favour, partly on account of injury done by
a careless use of the sulphuric acid, partly because it failed to
act when the acid had absorbed moisture from the atmosphere, but
principally because of its cost.

To obviate the objection arising from the use of sulphuric acid in
open bottles, an ingenious contrivance was adopted, by which each
match contained its own reservoir of acid sufficient for igniting
the inflammable compound. Small glass globules, containing sulphuric
acid, were introduced into the composition of chlorate of potass and
sugar, which, when broken, set fire to the mixture and lighted the
match. These instantaneous lights, which were called _Prometheans_,
were more ingenious than useful, because the trouble of manufacture
rendered them expensive, and the sulphuric acid was more likely to
injure furniture in that form than when a bottle with asbestos was
used. The Prometheans, however, possessed the advantage of portability,
and for occasional purposes they were convenient. In some of the forms
in which the Prometheans were manufactured, the glass globule of acid,
surrounded by its inflammable compound, was attached to the end of a
small stick of sealing-wax, sufficiently large to seal a letter; but
this refinement in instantaneous lights was not much patronized.

Notwithstanding these ingenious attempts to produce light by chemical
action, the flint-and-steel retained possession of the field until
a match was made that ignited by friction alone. The first kind of
friction match was invented in 1832. It consisted of a thin splinter
of dried wood, the top of which was dipped in a mixture of one part
of chlorate of potass, two of sulphide of antimony, and one of gum.
To ignite the match it was necessary to draw it briskly through
sand-paper. These matches required some address to light them, because
much more friction was required than is sufficient to light Lucifers.

The next improvement was the "Congreve" match, in which recourse
was had to the materials previously used, separately, for obtaining
instantaneous lights. Congreve matches were composed of an emulsion
of phosphorus mixed with chlorate of potass, into which the matches,
previously tipped with sulphur, were dipped. These matches were of
the same size and form as the Lucifers now in general use, and they
ignited readily by friction on sand-paper or other rough surface. Their
explosive noise on inflammation, which gave them their name, was the
only apparent difference between Congreves and Lucifers, and their
introduction completely supplanted the flint-and-steel.

The noiseless match, or Lucifer, has, in its turn, driven the Congreve
almost out of use, though for practical purposes the latter was as
effective, and it was less dangerous. The Lucifer matches depend
altogether on phosphorus for their inflammability. Their composition
is an emulsion of phosphorus with glue, nitre, and some colouring
matters. The sulphur matches, after having been tipped with that
composition, are exposed in a warm room until a sufficient quantity of
the phosphorus is evaporated by slow combustion, to leave a film of
glue on the surface to protect the remainder from the action of the
atmosphere. The usual proportions for the compound are, phosphorus
four parts, nitre ten, glue six, red ochre five, and smalt two. The
principle on which the action of Lucifer matches depends, is the strong
affinity of phosphorus for oxygen, of which the nitre with which it
is mixed contains an abundant supply; and by drawing the match across
sand-paper, sufficient heat is excited by the friction to ignite
the phosphorus, and the nitre supplies the oxygen to maintain rapid
combustion.

The manufacture of Lucifer matches is conducted on a very large scale
in this country and on the Continent. It requires several ship loads of
wood to supply the requirements of Lucifer-match makers; and ingenious
contrivances have been patented for cutting it up into splints of the
proper size. For that purpose, after the wood has been reduced to
the required lengths by circular saws, it is cut up into splints by
a number of lancet points, separated from each other as far apart as
the thickness of a match, which pass over the wood and divide it with
great rapidity. The splints are collected into bundles of one thousand,
and each end having been dipped into melted sulphur, they are divided
in the middle by a circular saw.

The Reports of the Juries of the Great Exhibition supply a variety of
statistical details respecting the manufacture of chemical matches,
from which it appears that the quantity made in Austria, in 1849,
amounted to 50,000 cwt.; and that in France, in 1850, the phosphorus
consumed in the manufacture of matches, amounted yearly to 590 cwt.;
and the consumption has rapidly increased since that time. In this
country, it is calculated that eight tons of phosphorus are yearly used
in making matches, the number of which is stated to be 40,000,000 a
day. Large quantities are also imported from Germany, where they are
manufactured so cheaply, that fifty boxes each containing 100 matches,
are sold for fourpence.

The latest improvement in chemical matches is the "Vesta," which
consists of small wax, or stearine tapers, with an igniting composition
at the end, consisting of chlorate of potass and phosphorus. These
Instantaneous Lights are made without sulphur, consequently the
disagreeable smell of the common Lucifer is avoided. The convenience
of smokers has also been consulted in the manufacture of Instantaneous
Lights. The fusees, now so frequently used for lighting cigars, are
composed of thin card-board cut half through, steeped in nitre and with
a small quantity of phosphorus; and the tearing of the paper across
produces sufficient heat to ignite the inflammable card.

Thousands of persons, principally children, are now employed in
the manufacture of chemical matches. The occupation, as at present
conducted, is very unhealthy, for the fumes of the phosphorus produce
a disease of a remarkable kind in the jaw-bone, which often proves
fatal. No cure has yet been found for this peculiar disease, occasioned
by the phosphorus in the state in which it is commonly used. A
preparation of that substance has, however, been made which may be used
without injury, and which possesses the advantage also of being less
dangerously inflammable; but as the red _amorphous phosphorus_, as it
is called, is rather more costly, the manufacturers of Lucifer matches
object to use it.




PAPER MAKING MACHINERY.


Cheap literature and the large development of newspapers are
principally attributable to the improvements in Paper Making, by the
aid of machinery.

In the former modes of making paper, the workman held in his hands a
square frame covered with wires, which he dipped into the prepared
cotton or linen pulp, which was kept in suspension by being agitated in
water, and taking up a quantity sufficient to cover the frame, he moved
the pulp about horizontally, to spread it evenly over the surface of
the wires. Another workman transferred the layer of pulp on to felt,
and in this manner one sheet was laid upon another, with felt between
each. They were next subjected to great pressure, for the purpose of
making the fibrous particles cohere sufficiently to form sheets of
paper. The felts were then removed, and the sheets were piled upon one
another and again pressed, after which they were dried, sized, and
finished.

Paper Making, by that process, was a slow operation. The thickness
and evenness of the sheets depended altogether on the judgment and
skill of the workman, and their size was necessarily limited by the
dimensions of the frame. By the improved methods, nearly all the work
is done by machinery. The soft fibrous pulp, which is to be converted
into paper, enters the machine at one end, and in the course of two
minutes it is delivered at the other end of the machine in a continuous
sheet, that may extend for miles. By supplemental contrivances the
paper is cut into sheets, piled together, and presented in a salable
form.

The world is indebted to a Frenchman, named Louis Robert, for the
invention of the first machine for making paper. He was a workman in
M. Didot's paper mill, at Essones, and for his contrivance of a method
for making continuous paper, he obtained from the French Government, in
1799, the sum of 8,000 francs and a patent for the manufacture of the
machines. The political agitation in France at that period prevented
much progress from being made with the invention, but after the Peace
of Amiens, in 1802, M. Didot, jun. came to this country, accompanied by
his brother-in-law, Mr. Gamble, for the purpose of making arrangements
to carry it into effect. They induced Messrs. H. and S. Fourdrinier to
engage with them in bringing the machinery to perfection, and patents
obtained in this country by Mr. Gamble were assigned to them in 1804.

The engineering establishment of Mr. Hall, at Dartford, in Kent, was
selected as best adapted for the purpose of making the machinery and
for carrying the plans into operation. Mr. Bryan Donkin, who was
engaged in the manufactory, principally assisted in bringing the
machinery to perfection. The difficulties attending the completion of
all the parts, to get them to work effectually, and the obstruction
encountered in introducing the machine-made paper, rendered the
enterprise a ruinous speculation to those who first engaged in it.
Messrs. Fourdrinier having expended £60,000 in perfecting the machine.

[Illustration]

The apparatus, of which a representation is given in the annexed
woodcut, was very complicated, but the essential parts may be readily
understood.

The rags from which the paper is made undergo a variety of processes
before they are properly reduced into a state of pulp. They are sorted,
dusted, boiled, and torn into pieces by passing through cutting
rollers; they are then bleached and again submitted to the grinding
action of rollers, which reduce them into a state of fine pulp,
resembling milk in appearance. The pulp thus prepared is placed in a
large vat, where it is kept constantly agitated, to prevent the more
solid parts from being deposited. From the vat the pulp is discharged
into a cistern, over the edge of which it flows in a continuous stream
upon an endless wire cloth, the meshes of which are so fine that there
are as many as 6,000 holes in a square inch.

The wire gauze, on to which the pulp is poured, is about 4 feet wide,
and 25 feet long, and it is kept constantly moving onwards, by rollers
at each end, over which it passes. The gauze is stretched out perfectly
level, and the pulp is prevented from flowing over the edges by straps
on each side, which limit the width of the paper. As the endless
wire cloth moves along, an agitating motion is given to it, by which
means the pulp is spread evenly over the surface; the water is also
drained off through the interstices of the gauze, and this part of the
process is expedited in the improved machines by producing a partial
vacuum underneath. Before the sheet of pulp has arrived at the farther
extremity of the wire cloth, it passes between two cylinders, the under
one of which is of metal, covered with felt, and the upper one of wood.
A slight pressure given to the pulp in passing between those cylinders
imparts sufficient tenacity to it to enable it to be transferred from
the wire gauze on to an endless web of felt, by means of a slice that
clears the pulp from the wire gauze, and deposits it on the felt. The
latter is kept moving at exactly the same speed as the wire gauze,
otherwise there would be either a rent or a fold on the sheet. The
paper, still in a very wet state, is carried between cast iron rollers,
and its fibres are forcibly pressed together, which operation squeezes
out the water, and so far gives tenacity to the pulp that it may be
handled without tearing. The sheet then passes on to other rollers, by
which it is further compressed, and its surface smoothened. The paper
is, however, still damp, and requires to be dried. This is done by
passing it over large metal cylinders, heated by steam. The process of
making the paper is then completed, and the continuous sheet may be
wound upon a reel to any length; but it is now usual to cut it up into
sheets as soon as it leaves the drying cylinders.

The wire cloth moves at the rate of from 25 to 40 feet per minute, and
such a machine would consequently make at least 10 yards of paper in
that time, which is equal to a mile in three hours. The width of the
paper is usually about 4½ feet, therefore each machine will make 10,450
square yards of paper in twelve hours; and there are upwards of three
hundred of such machines at work in this country. The value of the
paper thus produced is calculated to exceed two millions sterling.

Numerous improvements have been made in Fourdrinier's original machine,
but the principle of its construction remains essentially the same,
and it is by this means that most of the paper now used for writing
or printing is manufactured. A paper-making machine, on a different
principle, has, however, been invented by Mr. Dickinson, and has been
carried by him to great perfection. Instead of allowing the pulp to
fall on to a flat surface of wire gauze, a polished hollow brass
cylinder, perforated with holes and covered with wire cloth, revolves
in contact with the prepared pulp, and a partial vacuum being produced
within the cylinder, the pulp adheres to the gauze, and its fibres
cohere sufficiently, before the cylinder has completed a revolution, to
be turned off on to another cylinder covered with felt, on which it is
subjected to pressure by rollers, and is thence delivered to the drying
cylinders.

Mr. Dickinson afterwards obtained a patent, in 1855, for making a union
paper, consisting of a thin sheet of that made by his own machine, and
a similar sheet made by a Fourdrinier machine united together. For
this purpose the two sheets were brought together, as they passed from
the machines, whilst still wet and in an unfinished state, and were
pressed together between rollers, by which means they were completely
incorporated. The object of this contrivance was to combine, in a
single sheet, the different kinds of surface which paper made by those
two modes of manufacture present. It is also employed economically
for engravings, to give a fine surface to a thick sheet of coarser
material. The threads in postage envelopes and in bankers' cheques, are
introduced by this process of plating two surfaces together.

The greatly increased consumption of paper threatened to exhaust
the supply of the raw material, notwithstanding the large import
from abroad and the enormous supply derived from the waste of the
cotton mills, which, when mixed with rags, produces good paper. The
quantity of old rags, old junk, and other fibrous materials imported
for the purpose of making paper, in 1850, is stated in the Jury
Reports of the Great Exhibition to have amounted to 8,124 tons.
This large importation, added to the stock of rags supplied by the
country itself, was, however, inadequate to meet the consumption, and
search was anxiously made for other fibrous substances that could be
converted into paper;--peat, cocoa-nut fibre, grass, straw, and even
wood have been used for the purpose. Of those substances, straw has
been most successfully applied, and straw paper--excellent to write
upon, though not bright in colour--is now made at very low prices.
The straw is first cut up into short lengths, of about half an inch,
by a chaff-cutting machine, and after undergoing various processes of
trituration and bleaching, it is reduced into a pulp, sufficiently
adhesive to make a strong paper.

The plan of drying the paper as it leaves the rollers of the machine,
was introduced by Mr. Crompton in 1820, and that gentleman was also the
first to introduce a machine for cutting the paper into sheets as soon
as it is dried. The first invention of the kind was patented by Mr.
Crompton, in conjunction with Mr. Miller and Professor Cowper, in 1828.
The continuous web of paper was made to pass directly from the drying
apparatus to the cutting machine, by which it was first slit into bands
of the required width by means of a series of sharp discs of steel,
adjustable on two parallel axes. The bands of paper then passed on to
shears, placed transversely, that cut it into sheets of any required
length, which were laid upon one another, to be divided into quires.

Several other cutting machines have since been invented, the simplest
of which is the one patented by Mr. Dickinson, which is represented in
the woodcut.

[Illustration]

The paper may be taken directly from the drying cylinders or from a
reel, as shown in the diagram at _a_. The sheet passes over a large
drum and through several guide rollers, till it is carried across
the table _a h_, where it is cut lengthwise by knives, as it passes
along. A series of chisel-edged cutters are placed at regulated
distances beneath the table; and whilst the paper is stretched over
it, several circular knives, _f f_, fixed into a swing frame, _g g_,
at corresponding distances with the knives beneath, are swung across
the sheet, and cut it in the manner of a pair of shears. Other kinds of
cutting machines are contrived, by which sheets of writing paper, when
collected in quires, are squeezed tightly together, and their edges are
smoothly and evenly cut.

We must not conclude this notice of Paper Making Machinery without
alluding to the ingenious self-acting mechanisms for making envelopes.
In the Great Exhibition of 1851 there were three different machines
exhibited in action, each one producing, with great rapidity, those
neat coverings for letters, for which the penny postage system has
created so great a demand. The paper, cut into the desired form by a
separate machine, was piled up on one side of the envelope folder.
It was taken, sheet by sheet, and stretched on a small table, on the
middle of which there was a trap door, held up by a spring to a level
with the rest of the table. A plunger, of the same size as the envelope
to be made, pressed the trap down into a recess, and raised the four
corners of the paper, the edges of which were then gummed, and small
mechanical fingers folded them down. The completed envelope was then
thrown out into a basket, or it slided out of the machine on to those
before made.

Each of those machines, with a boy as an attendant, will fold
2,700 envelopes in an hour, which is nearly the same number that
an experienced workman can fold in a day with a folding stick.
Notwithstanding the supplanting of manual labour to so great an extent
by these ingenious mechanisms, the effect of increased facility of
manufacture has been to give increased employment, and many more
persons are now engaged in making envelopes than were so employed
before the invention of the machines.




PRINTING MACHINES.


The associated inventions of paper making and printing have progressed
hand in hand together; the increased facility with which paper can
be made by machinery having been equalled, if not surpassed, by the
rapidity with which it can be printed.

The old wooden printing press, that was in general use at the beginning
of the present century, is now an object of curiosity, and a few
specimens of it are to be seen, even in country printing offices.

The principal working part of the wooden press consisted of a block
of wood, having a perfectly flat and smooth surface, half the size of
an ordinary sheet of printing paper, which was brought down upon the
types by means of a screw that was turned by a long lever. The types,
placed upon a flat stone embedded in a movable table, were inked with
large soft balls covered with pelts. The damped paper was put into a
frame, at the back of which blankets were placed, and was laid lightly
on the inked types. The movable table was then pushed under the block
of wood, called the "platten," the long lever was pulled with great
strength, and the platten being thus brought forcibly upon the blankets
and paper, one-half of the sheet was printed. The lever, on being
released, sprang back to its former position, and the table with the
types upon it was pushed farther under the platten, which was again
pulled down to print the other half of the sheet. The table was then
pulled back, and the sheet of paper, printed on one side, was removed.
These operations occupied considerable time, and the regular work of
two men, with a wooden press, was to print 250 sheets an hour on one
side.

This original contrivance for printing was supplanted by the Stanhope
press, one of the most admirable arrangements for the advantageous
application of the lever that is to be found in the whole range of
mechanical contrivances.

The improved printing press, invented by Lord Stanhope, the first of
which was completed in 1800, is made altogether of iron. The platten is
of the full size of the sheet of paper to be printed, and the work is
done at a single pull. The requisite power is obtained by a combination
of levers, so adjusted that the platten is brought down rapidly in the
first instance, before any pressure is required, and when it comes
to bear upon the types, the levers act with the greatest possible
mechanical advantage, so that the handle moves through the space of a
foot, whilst the platten descends only the twentieth part of an inch.
By this means a large sheet of paper can be printed off by a single
pull, and with more impression and greater sharpness than by two pulls
with a wooden press.

Great as was this improvement in the printing press, its action was
still very slow, compared with the rapidity of printing we are now
accustomed to, it being considered quick work, with a small Stanhope
press, to print 500 sheets an hour. The author remembers to have seen
the _Globe_ newspaper printed by an old wooden press in 1820; and,
about the same time, the London _Courier_, by a Stanhope press. In
order to supply the large demand for the latter paper, it was then
customary to print off three pages early in the day, and to set up
the types for the fourth page, containing the latest news, three or
four times, and to print it at as many separate presses. The pressmen
could thus, by great exertion, perfect the printing, when three presses
were used, at the rate of 1,500 an hour. The _Times_ newspaper, which
greatly exceeds the size of the _Courier_, is now printed by a machine
at the rate of 13,000 an hour.

The invention of printing machines was preceded by the manufacture of
inking rollers, to supersede the pelt balls for distributing the ink
over the types. Earl Stanhope had endeavoured in vain to construct
inking rollers, for which purpose he tried skins and pelts of various
kinds, but the seam proved an obstacle that he could not overcome. In
1808, a "new elastic composition ball for printing," which consisted
principally of treacle and glue, to serve as a substitute for pelts,
was invented by Mr. Edward Dyas, a man of great original genius,
the parish clerk of Madeley, in Shropshire. These balls were first
introduced into the extensive printing office of the late Mr. Edward
Houlston, of Wellington, where they were for some time exclusively
used, and that printing-office consequently became celebrated for the
excellence of its work. A similar composition was some years afterwards
cast in the form of rollers, upon a hollow core of wood, by the late
Mr. Harrild; and these rollers have proved a far more cleanly and more
expeditious mode of inking the types than the balls. These inking
rollers supplied an essential want in the working of Printing Machines.

The invention of Printing Machines underwent many changes before it
was brought to a practical form. Such a machine was first projected
in 1790, by Mr. Nicholson, who proposed to place the types and paper
upon cylinders, and to distribute and apply the ink also by cylinders.
Another plan, more closely approaching that of the printing machines
afterwards perfected by Mr. Napier and others, was to place the types
upon a table and the paper upon an impressing cylinder, and to move
the table backwards and forwards under it. In 1813, Messrs. Donkin and
Bacon proposed placing the types upon a prism, which was to revolve
against an irregularly shaped cylinder, on which the paper was to be
placed. Nothing, however, could be effectually done in producing a
proper working printing machine until the invention of inking rollers.

In 1814, Messrs. Bauer and Kœnig succeeded in constructing a machine,
which was erected at the _Times_ office, that produced 1,800
impressions an hour; and it continued in use till 1827. This rapidity
of action, compared with that of the most improved printing press,
produced a revolution in the art of printing; attention was then
directed almost exclusively to the further improvement of the machines,
and the platten press was neglected.

In the form of printing machines generally used, the types are laid
upon an iron table that is moved to and fro by the turning of a wheel
connected with a steam engine. The paper is placed upon cylinders
covered with flannel, and the impression of the types is produced by
the cylinders being fixed so closely to them that, as the table passes
backwards and forwards, there is great pressure. The types are inked by
a series of rollers, by which the ink is distributed and evenly laid on
the face of the types without any manual labour.

The mechanical power gained by an arrangement of this kind arises from
the pressure being exerted on a small surface at a time; consequently
the power required for producing the impression of the types is not
nearly so great as when the whole surface of the types makes the
impression at the same instant. The force actually pressing on the
types, from contact with the cylinders, is very much less than that
brought to bear on them by the platten of the Stanhope press; but as
it acts on a smaller surface at a time, the amount of pressure on
each part, successively, greatly exceeds that received by any similar
portion when it is impressed all at once. The difference of the action
of the platten and of the cylinder may be compared to the different
effects produced by a knife when pressed with its edge and with its
flat side against a yielding surface; the pressure on the flat surface
may not be sufficient to leave any impression, whilst a much smaller
pressure on the edge will produce an indentation.

[Illustration]

The accompanying woodcut is a representation of one of Messrs.
Applegath and Cowper's machines for printing both sides of the paper at
the same time.

It consists of a cast-iron frame, about 14 feet long and 4 feet wide,
on which the iron table, with the types upon it, slides backward and
forward under two large cast-iron cylinders, covered with blankets,
whereon the paper is laid. The pages of type to be printed on one side
of the paper, and those pages that are to be printed on the back, are
wedged into iron frames, called "chases," and these chases are fixed
on the table at such a distance from each other, that they will pass
under the two cylinders in the same relative positions. The sheets of
paper are held on to the cylinders at their edges by means of tapes,
and are so laid on by the workmen, that the type may be impressed on
them with an equal margin all round. At each end of the machine is
a supply of ink, which is taken from long iron rollers, about three
inches in diameter, each of which turns in contact with a flat iron
bar, that only allows a small quantity of ink to pass. A composition
inking roller is made to vibrate between the inking table, where on the
ink is thinly and evenly spread, and the iron feeding roller, and thus
delivers the requisite quantity of ink on to the table. Several other
composition rollers are placed across the inking table, with their
axes resting in notched bearings, so that as the inking table moves
forward and backward, those rollers distribute the ink evenly over it.
There are four other rollers (none of which are shown in the diagram),
which take the ink from the table; and as the types pass from under
the cylinders, after printing a sheet, and return to them, they pass
twice under the inking rollers. Each sheet of paper is laid by a boy on
a web of tapes, by which it is carried round one paper cylinder, and
then over and under two wooden drums to the other paper cylinder. The
sheet of paper, in the course of its progress, is turned over, so as to
receive the second impression on the other side; and as the tapes that
carry it along leave the second cylinder, they divide, and the printed
sheet falls into the hands of a boy.

In the printing machine which was shown at work in the Great
Exhibition, invented by Mr. Applegath and made by Mr. Middleton, for
printing the _Times_, the arrangements differ materially from those of
the horizontal machines already described. The types, instead of being
placed on a table, and moved to and fro under the impressing cylinders,
are fixed to a large vertical cylinder, upwards of 16 feet in diameter,
and there are eight impressing cylinders ranged vertically round it,
with their axes fixed. By this arrangement there is no loss of time in
withdrawing the types from under the cylinder to be again inked, but
they move round from one fixed cylinder to another, receiving their
ink between each, and thus producing eight impressions in succession
during one complete revolution. At the _Times_ printing office there
are now three machines of that construction, two of which, with eight
cylinders, print ten thousand an hour, and the other one, which has
nine impressing cylinders, thirteen thousand.

The operations for printing that newspaper exhibit marvellous efforts
of human ingenuity and skill, brought to bear in producing with the
requisite rapidity a sufficient number of impressions to supply its
enormous circulation. After the types have been composed and corrected,
and ranged into columns and screwed up into their chases by upwards of
one hundred hands, each page of type is attached to the large vertical
cylinder--a curved form having been given to the type to adapt it to
the circular surface. Nine men, standing each one beside a heap of
damped paper, feed the largest machine by separating the sheets singly
from the heap, and present them successively to the action of small
rollers, that give each sheet a forward impulse, which brings it within
the grasp of a series of endless tapes. These tapes catch hold of the
sheets of paper, and carry them down to the level of the types. They
are then shot along horizontally to the pressing rollers, covered with
blankets, round which they are carried and pressed against the types;
after which the endless tapes carry them away, and deliver them printed
to a man below, who spreads them one over the other. A large reservoir
of ink at the top of the machine supplies the inking tables, from which
it is spread evenly over the inking rollers, and, at each revolution
of the type cylinder, nine sheets are printed on one side. They are
then taken to a second machine to be printed on the back, or, as it
is called, "perfected." The accompanying engraving shows the general
arrangement of the machines.

Few mechanical contrivances present so striking an illustration of
the application of human ingenuity to the production of important
results, and to the saving of labour, as these printing machines. To
see the sheets of paper travelling along the tapes--to see them shoot
downwards, carried sideways in one direction and back again, and
delivered with half a million of words impressed upon them in less than
three seconds, seems like the work of magic. To copy that number of
words, thus printed in three seconds, would occupy a rapid penman forty
days, working ten hours a day.

[Illustration]

Great as are the printing powers of these machines of Mr. Applegath's,
they have been surpassed more recently by one placed close beside them,
invented by Mr. Hoe, of New York. In that machine the type cylinder
is placed horizontally, by which means the paper is supplied directly
to it without altering its direction. As many as twenty thousand
impressions in an hour have been produced by the American machine, but
it is not yet sufficiently perfected to be brought into regular use.

In another part of the _Times_ establishment there is an ingenious
machine for wetting the paper, by which contrivance much labour and
time are saved. The paper, heaped in a pile at one end of a table, is
presented in quires at a time to the action of a roller, which drags
it on to a moving endless blanket, that is kept wet by a stream of
water, and the upper surface is wetted by a long brush, placed over
the blanket. The wetted paper is heaped upon a truck, which gradually
descends, to keep the upper sheets on a level with the table, till
the paper is piled up a yard in thickness. The truck is then raised,
by hydraulic pressure, to the level of the floor, and is wheeled away
and another one is loaded. Between nine and ten tons of paper are thus
wetted daily; and the sheets of the _Times_ printed during a year, if
spread out and piled one upon another, would form a column as high
as Mont Blanc. The quantity of ink daily consumed in the printing
is upwards of two hundredweight. The machine is worked by two steam
engines, each of 16-horse power; and the noise of the numerous wheels
and rapidly revolving cylinders is almost deafening.

The great rapidity and the comparative cheapness of printing by
machines, together with the greater facility of making paper by
machinery, have been the means of creating a demand for books which
it would be impossible to supply, unless those means were at command.
Thousands and hundreds of thousands of copies of publications, that
spread knowledge among the people of the highest interest to the
welfare of man, and replete with useful information of every kind,
are now sold at prices which would be impossible, were it not for the
improvements that have been made in the manufacture of paper, and in
the means of printing.

Nor should we omit to notice, as one of the causes that have
contributed to the production of cheap literature, the art of
stereotyping, which has been perfected during the present century. Earl
Stanhope, the inventor of the admirable press that bears his name, was
prominent in bringing that art to perfection.

Numerous attempts had been made in the last century to produce casts
from pages of type. So early, indeed, as 1700, some almanacks and
pamphlets were printed in Paris from castings; and an edition of
Sallust was printed in Edinburgh in 1739, from stereotype plates
produced by Mr. Ged, a goldsmith. The process, however, was not
encouraged, and on his death it was not further proceeded with. The
most important advance in the art was made by M. Hoffman, of Alsace,
who, in 1784, succeeded in obtaining stereotype plates by casting
them in moulds of clay mixed with gelatine in which the pages of
type were impressed, with which he printed a work in three volumes;
but the castings were imperfect, and the plan was soon afterwards
abandoned. Among the many plans tried to obtain perfect casts of the
types when set up, was one contrived by M. Carez, a printer of Toul,
who, in 1791, endeavoured to obtain casts in lead from a page of type,
by allowing it to drop on the fused metal when it was in a state of
setting. The matrices thus obtained were in like manner impressed on a
fusible metal, which melted at a lower temperature than the lead. Good
casts were often thus procured, but the uncertainty of the process,
arising from the frequent fusion of the lead matrices, caused it to
be discontinued. Other plans were tried in France with more or less
success, but nothing was done practically until Lord Stanhope directed
his attention to the subject in 1800, and resorted to the original
method of obtaining matrices, by impressing the pages of type in a cold
plastic substance. He employed plaster of Paris for his mould; and when
they were thoroughly dried, they were plunged in fused type-metal; and
in this manner a perfect cast in metal of the original page of movable
type was produced. The process has been still further perfected, and
casts from movable types, and from wood engravings, are now made with
great facility, and the impressions from them are quite equal to the
originals.

When it is intended to stereotype a work, the movable types used in
composing it are new, and the "spaces" that separate the words from
each other are longer than is customary when the type is to be printed
from. These elongated spaces reach nearly to the face of the letters,
so that the plaster may not sink between them. By this means the mould
is easily removed from the face of the page of type. The metal casting
of each page is very thin, and when required to be used, it is screwed
on to blocks of wood to the same height as ordinary types.

Several attempts have been made to apply other substances than plaster
of Paris and type-metal for stereotyping. At the Great Exhibition there
were specimens of gutta percha stereotypes, that produced excellent
impressions, and there were also fine stereotype castings of type in
iron, from which a copy of the Bible had been printed. Papier maché has
been found to be a material peculiarly applicable for the purpose, and
it is now superseding the use of plaster of Paris for taking casts of
the types.

By the application of the art of stereotyping, casts in metal of
valuable works can be kept ready at any time, to be printed from when
more copies are required; and the expense is saved of keeping on hand
large stocks of printed paper, or of having a work recomposed when a
further edition is wanted.

The inventions of Printing Machines and stereotyping were strongly
opposed at first by pressmen and compositors, as calculated to diminish
the demand for their labour. In "Johnson's Typographia," published
in 1824, the "new-fangled articles" are mentioned in a spirit of
great bitterness; and the writer thus poured forth his lamentations
at the prospective ruin of the members of his profession:--"We are
much surprised at the apathy and supineness shown by the body of
master printers with respect to the subject under discussion; they
most assuredly had good and sufficient grounds for an application to
Parliament for a tax, that should bring the work so executed upon an
equality with that done by manual labour."--"We feel satisfied that the
above would not have met with encouragement from a British public, had
they been aware of the evils attendant on it; they have not only to pay
a full price for the work, but also extra poor's rates, in consequence
of the men being thus out of employ; likewise they are countenancing
the breaking up and destruction of all the energy and talent of that
art which was England's proudest boast, and her shield against all the
threats of her foreign foes."

These predictions of ruin have been completely falsified. It has been
with the Printing Machines as with most other improved machinery for
the saving of labour: on their first introduction some hands, no doubt,
were thrown out of employ, but the advantages derived from the saving
of labour very soon reacted favourably in creating a greater demand for
labour than before. The number of cheap periodicals, and the extensive
issues of cheap literature in every form, require a much larger number
of workmen to supply the demand, even with the aid of machinery, than
was needed in the best days of the manual printing press; and at no
time were so many compositors and pressmen employed as at present.

In the Reports of the Juries of the Great Exhibition, some interesting
statistics are given, showing the influence of the invention of
Printing Machines in extending the demand for books and periodicals.
"The machine," it is observed, "created a demand, and called into
existence books which, but for it, would scarcely have been thought
of. As the machine-work from type and woodcuts was far better than
the ordinary printing of the day, booksellers were induced to print
extensive editions, because they saw the machine could accomplish all
they required. One of the first booksellers who availed himself of this
power was Mr. Charles Knight, who projected the 'Penny Magazine,' on
a hint from Mr. M. D. Hill, Queen's Counsel. Each number, published
weekly, consisted of eight pages of letterpress, illustrated with
good wood engravings. The public was astonished at the cheapness and
good quality of the work, but it was its immense sale which rendered
it profitable; for some years it amounted to 180,000 copies weekly.
Mr. Knight, whose services in the cause of educational literature
entitle him to the highest praise, expended £5,000 a year in woodcuts
for this work. The Cowper machine has been the cause of the many
pictorial illustrations which characterize so large a portion of
modern publications. The 'Saturday Magazine,' 'Chambers' Journal,'
the 'Magasin Pittoresque,' in France, and numerous others, owe their
existence to this printing machine. The principle of _cheap editions
and large sales_ soon extended to established works of a higher value.
A remarkable instance of this was the edition of Sir Walter Scott's
Works, with notes, edited by himself; instead of the old price 10s.
6d., they were sold at 5s. a volume,[15] and the demand created by
this reduction in price was so great, that, though the printer had a
strong prejudice against machines, he was compelled to have them, the
presses of his large establishment proving totally unable to perform
the work, which amounted to upwards of 1,000 volumes per day for about
two years. The Universities of Cambridge and Oxford have adopted Mr.
Cowper's machines for printing vast numbers of Bibles, prayer-books,
&c., &c. A Bible which formerly cost 3s. may now be had for 1s. Mr.
Cowper recommended the Religious Tract Society to put aside their
coarse woodcuts, to have superior wood engravings, and to print with
his machine. The Society adopted those suggestions, and the result is,
that by sending forth well-printed books, it could now support itself
by their sale, without any aid from subscriptions."

As an illustration of the facilities afforded by the invention of
Printing Machines in producing cheap editions of the writings of
popular authors, the following curious facts relating to the Works of
Sir Walter Scott, in addition to those furnished in the Reports of the
Juries, may be found interesting.

In 1842, a general issue of these Works, in weekly sheets or numbers,
at twopence each, was commenced by the late Mr. Robert Cadell, of
Edinburgh, and completed in 1847. Of this edition, up to the present
period (1858), the astonishing number of TWELVE MILLIONS OF SHEETS
have been issued, the weight of which amounts to upwards of 335
tons! Another edition was published simultaneously by Mr. Cadell in
monthly volumes at 4s., each containing about 360 pages; this series
has reached a sale of more than 500,000 volumes. A third cheap issue,
at eighteenpence a novel, is now being published by the present
proprietors, Messrs. Adam and Charles Black, of Edinburgh. Nearly
300,000 volumes have already been printed of this edition.

It may be mentioned here, although hardly coming within the scope
of the present article, but as affording a striking example of what
literature has contributed to the revenue of the country in the person
of a single author, that upwards of 3,500 tons' weight of paper[16]
have been consumed in producing the various editions of Sir Walter
Scott's Writings and Life; and the duty paid to Government on the
paper, even at the present reduced rate, amounts to no less a sum than
£51,450!

Since the Juries made their Reports, the development of cheap
literature has been greatly extended. Newspapers, some of which contain
eight full-sized pages, of six columns each, printed in small type, are
sold for the marvellously low price of a penny, and are stated to issue
as many as 50,000 copies daily; and some of the newspapers and other
periodicals, printed on good paper, are issued for a halfpenny. Among
the works of a standard character, published at prices which nothing
but a very extensive scale could make remunerative, may be mentioned
the popular series which includes "The Reason Why," and "Enquire Within
upon Everything." Of the eight volumes already issued, each containing
about 350 closely printed pages for half-a-crown, nearly 170,000 copies
have been sold within a period of less than three years.




LITHOGRAPHY.


The art of printing from stone was invented at the end of the last
century by M. Aloys Senefelder, of Munich; but it was not brought to
such a state of perfection as to be practically useful until many years
afterwards.

The principle on which Lithography depends is the different chemical
affinities of water for oily and for earthy substances, which cause
it to run off from the one and adhere to the other. The drawing or
writing is made in oily ink upon a smooth calcareous stone that will
absorb water, so that, when the stone is moistened, the water adheres
to it and leaves the lines of the drawing traced upon it dry. An inking
roller, charged with an oily ink, is then passed over the stone and
inks the drawing, but leaves all the other parts of the stone quite
clean. A damped paper is next laid on, and when subjected to great
pressure, an exact copy of the drawing or writing is produced.

This simple and ingenious process has been carried to such perfection,
that the most beautiful artistic effects can be produced by it far
more economically than by any other style of engraving; and further
improvements in the art are being continually made. It is satisfactory,
therefore, to be able to trace its history from its very beginnings, of
which an interesting account has been published by the inventor himself.

M. Senefelder's father was an actor at Munich, and in his youth he
followed the same profession. He turned his attention afterwards to
music; and it was in his attempts to devise some means of printing
his compositions economically that he chanced to discover the art of
Lithography.

He had previously made himself acquainted with the methods of
copper-plate printing, and he commenced his operations by etching the
notes of music on copper-plates, covered with varnish in the ordinary
way. He found, however, that it would require much practice to enable
him to do this properly, and not being able to buy copper-plates for
his rude essays, he thought of practising upon stones. Fortunately for
the success of his efforts, the quarries at Solenhofen, near Munich,
supplied him with slabs of stone admirably adapted for the purpose; and
it is a remarkable coincidence, that the material which Senefelder used
for his experiments is the best for the purpose of Lithography that
has hitherto been discovered. His chief object in making use of these
slabs of stone was to practise himself in the manipulation of writing
the notes, and of biting them in with _aqua-fortis_ (nitric acid),
as he supposed the slabs would be too brittle to bear the action of
the press. He did not try, therefore, to have these etchings on stone
proved by the press, but he contented himself with holding them up to a
mirror to observe the progress he was making in writing backwards.

Having at length been supplied with much thicker slabs of stone, to
bear the requisite pressure, he endeavoured to grind and polish them
sufficiently for the purpose of being printed from, in the same manner
as copper-plates. He succeeded to some extent in doing so, by means
of diluted nitric acid; and he contrived to obtain about fifty good
impressions from the stone.

In all these attempts at Lithography, the lines were etched into the
stone by the action of nitric acid, and the only advantages professed
to be gained by the process were the questionable ones of comparative
cheapness of material, and greater facility of working. M. Senefelder
admits that there was nothing new in engraving upon stone; all that
he claims in that part of the invention is, the manner of polishing
the surface, and the composition of the ink adapted for printing
from it. The most important step in the progress of the invention of
Lithography, as at present practised, was made by accident, which he
thus describes:--

"I was preparing a slab of stone for engraving, when my mother asked
me to write a memorandum of things she was about to send to be washed.
The washerwoman was waiting impatiently whilst we searched in vain for
a piece of paper, and the common writing ink was dried up. Having no
other writing materials, I wrote the washing bill on the stone I was
about to prepare for engraving, using for the purpose my ink made of
wax, soap, and lamp-black, intending to copy it afterwards on paper.
Whilst looking at the letters I had written, the idea all at once
occurred to me how it would do to cover the stone, with the writing
upon it, with aqua-fortis, so as to leave them in relief, and then to
print from them in the same manner as woodcuts, with a common letter
press. The attempts I had hitherto made to engrave upon stone had
taught me that the relief of the letters thus obtained would not be
much. Nevertheless, I made the attempt. I mixed one part of aqua-fortis
with five parts of water, and poured it on the stone to the height of
two inches, having previously walled it round with wax in the usual
manner. The diluted aqua-fortis was permitted to rest on the stone five
minutes. I then examined the effect, and I found that the letters were
raised above the stone about the thickness of a card. Most of the lines
were uninjured, and retained their original size and thickness. This
gave me the assurance that writing, sufficiently traced, especially
if the letters were in printed characters, would have still greater
relief."[17]

Though M. Senefelder had advanced thus far, he had not yet made
application of the chemical properties of ink and water, which
constitute the distinguishing characteristics of Lithography. That was
reserved for a further discovery, also brought about by accident. The
difficulty he experienced in writing words on the stone in the reverse
way, induced him to adopt the plan of writing the letters on paper with
a soft black-lead pencil, and then transferring them on to the stone by
pressure. He subsequently used lithographic ink for the purpose; and in
the course of his experiments he observed, that when a paper written on
with lithographic ink, and well dried, was dipped into water on which
some oil was floating, the oil adhered to the writing, and left the
rest of the paper clean, and that this effect was most striking when
the water contained some gum in solution. This discovery induced him
to try the effect on printed paper; and, taking a printed page from
an old book, he moistened it with gum-water, and afterwards sponged
the whole surface with oil colour. The colour adhered to the letters,
and left the paper clean, and after further experiments he succeeded
in printing as many as fifty copies from a page of printed paper; the
letters, of course, being reversed. The idea then suggested itself of
transferring, on to stone, letters written with lithographic ink upon
paper. The plan succeeded, and the principle of the art of Lithography
was thus applied to practice. M. Senefelder, in his subsequent
improvements, gave a slight relief to the letters by the original plan
of using diluted aqua-fortis, by which means the impressions obtained
were blacker. He also contrived the means of printing in colours from
stone, by reversing the process of ordinary lithographic printing. To
produce coloured prints, he left uncovered all the parts that were to
receive the colour, and the other parts of the stone were covered with
an oleaginous fluid, that quickly dried. On applying any water-colour
to the stone, it adhered to the uncovered surface, and not to the
covered parts, and that colour was transferred to paper by pressure. In
this manner, by using several stones properly prepared, the different
colours required were printed, and the effect of a coloured drawing was
produced. Thus we perceive, that almost at the first invention of the
art of Lithography, the ingenious inventor showed the way of applying
it to the production of coloured prints, a process which has lately
been carried to great perfection.

Senefelder lived to see his invention extensively adopted, and to reap
benefit from his ingenuity. He died at Munich, in 1834, after having
been many years the director of the Government lithographic office;
and, in the latter years of his life he received a handsome pension
from the King of Bavaria.

There is little to be added to the description of the process of
Lithography, beyond that given by the original inventor in 1819, the
principal advances that have been made in the art having consisted
in improved methods of manipulating. The ink now generally employed
for drawing on the stone consists of equal parts of tallow, wax,
shell-lack, and soap, mixed with about one-twentieth part of
lamp-black; but the composition is varied, according to the kind
of design to be executed. For writing or drawing upon paper, to be
transferred to the stone, more wax is added to the ink, to give it
greater tenacity.

The drawing upon paper, to be transferred to stone, is not attended
with any difficulty, and may be done by ordinary artists. The ink
is applied with a pen, or camel's hair pencil, and when the effect
of chalk drawings is required to be imitated, the ink is shaded by
means of stumps, similar to those used in chalk drawings on paper.
Some artists prefer to work directly on the stone with a camel's hair
pencil, or with a composition called lithographic chalk.

To transfer the drawing from paper on to the stone, the paper is first
sponged with diluted nitric acid, which decomposes the size, and
renders it bibulous. After being placed for an instant between blotting
paper, to remove superfluous moisture, it is laid with the drawing
downwards on the stone, which is slightly warmed. The stone is then
passed through the press, and the drawing adheres firmly to it. To
remove the paper, it is wetted at the back with water, and, when quite
soft, it is rubbed with the hand. In this manner every particle of the
fibrous pulp is cleared away, and the drawing or writing in ink remains
as if it had been drawn directly on the stone. To prepare the stone for
taking the ink, gum water is poured upon it, and it is rubbed over with
a rag containing printer's ink, which serves to blacken the writing and
prepares the lines for afterwards receiving the ink.

The lithograph thus prepared is given to the printer, who first etches
it, in the manner originally practised by M. Senefelder. The nitric
acid employed for the purpose is diluted with about thirty parts of
water, and it is poured over the stone whilst it is inclined on one
side. This process is repeated several times, the object of it being
not so much to give relief to the lines, as to roughen the surface of
the stone, and thus facilitate its absorption of water. The nitric
acid also removes the alkali from the drawing ink. In printing, gum is
added to the water with which the stone is moistened, as an additional
preventive of the ink adhering to those parts not drawn upon. The
printing ink is applied with large rollers, and the damped paper having
been placed carefully upon the stone, with blankets at the back, it is
passed through the press.

The lithographic press somewhat resembles in form an iron printing
press, but differs from it greatly in its mode of action. Instead of
the large flat plate that in a printing press is pulled down upon the
whole surface of the types, a long, narrow arm, called a scraper, is
brought to bear upon the stone, and the table whereon the stone is
laid is pushed forcibly under it, by which means a great pressure is
exerted on a smaller surface at successive times, instead of being
brought to bear all at once. In the principle of its action, indeed, a
lithographic press is like a printing machine, and steam lithographic
presses have been invented to work in a similar manner, though the
practical results have not generally been very successful.

Among the many applications of lithography, the transfer of
copper-plate engravings is one of the most useful. An impression of
the plate is taken on paper that is coated with a compound of flour,
plaster of Paris, and glue, and from the paper it is transferred to
stone. By this plan the original plate remains untouched, and the
printing from the stone is much cheaper than from the copper. Tinted
lithography and chromo-lithography, by which the beautiful effects
of coloured drawings are produced in the manner indicated by M.
Senefelder, have recently been applied very successfully.




AERATED WATERS.


The invention of soda-water, in the state in which it is now known,
as an effervescing beverage impregnated with three or four times its
volume of carbonic acid gas, is of very modern date. There are, indeed,
to be found in most of the old works on chemistry descriptions of
Nooth's apparatus for impregnating liquids with carbonic acid; but
all that was attempted to be done by that apparatus was to produce an
impregnation of the water with little more than the quantity of gas it
will naturally absorb under the pressure of the atmosphere. It was not
until about the year 1815 that mechanical pressure was applied to force
a larger quantity of gas into combination with water, to imitate the
briskly effervescing medicinal waters of Germany.

Mr. Schweppe and Mr. Paul were the first who introduced the manufacture
of artificial effervescing waters into England, and soda-water was then
considered, as tea was on its first introduction, entirely medicinal.
Indeed, the quantity of soda which was at that time usually dissolved
in the water gave it a disagreeable taste; but when the manufacturers
diminished the quantity of alkali, and increased the volume of gas
forced into the water, they produced a pleasant beverage, which soon
became in request for its refreshing, wholesome qualities.

The apparatus for the manufacture of soda-water, as it is usually
made on a large scale, consists of a strong vessel, furnished with a
safety valve, in which the water is impregnated with gas. This vessel,
containing about nine gallons, is made of thick wood, well seasoned and
nicely fitted, and bound round with strong iron hoops, the heads of the
cask being well secured by means of iron bolts and screw nuts. It is
requisite that the receiver should be capable of bearing a pressure of
at least six atmospheres, which is equal to 90 lbs. to the square inch.

The carbonic acid gas is generated from chalk or whiting and diluted
sulphuric acid. The materials are mixed together in a small closed
wooden or leaden vessel, provided with an agitator, that can be
worked by a handle fixed to a projecting axis at the top. The gas, as
generated, enters by a bent tube into a gas-holder, the opening of the
tube being under water. By this means the gas is freed from the fumes
of sulphuric acid vapour, and from the fine particles of chalk that
become mingled with it during its sudden liberation. The gas sometimes
undergoes a further purification, by passing through a gas washer,
before it is forced into the water.

A small force-pump, worked by a crank, with the assistance of a
fly-wheel, draws the carbonic acid from the gas-holder, and forces it
into the water. The combination of the gas and water is facilitated by
an agitator, the axle of which projects through a stuffing box, and it
is worked either by hand, or is turned by means of a small cog-wheel,
that works into the teeth of a larger one fixed to the crank axle, so
as to produce rapid rotation.

It is found requisite, in the first place, to expel the atmospheric air
in the receiver; for which purpose the safety valve is left open for a
short time after the gas is being forced in, otherwise it would retard
the impregnation of the water by the gas. When the gas and water are
well incorporated, the liquid will contain as many volumes of gas as
there are atmospheres of pressure in the air-space above it in a state
ready to effervesce, and one other volume, with water absorbs under
the pressure of the atmosphere. Thus, when there are three atmospheres
of gas under pressure, each bottle of soda-water contains four bottles
full of gas, which are absorbed without perceptibly increasing its
bulk. The perfect impregnation of the water with gas, however,
requires time. The water will, indeed, become brisk almost as soon as
two or three atmospheres of gas have been forced in, but it will not
acquire the flavour of good soda-water until the gas and water have
been allowed at least half an hour to digest; and it is improved by
remaining in contact for several hours.

The temperature has considerable influence in the process of
impregnation, for in hot weather the gas will not combine so readily,
nor will the water absorb an equal volume of gas. In summer time,
therefore, soda-water should be made before the heat of the day, and
ice should be added to the water.

When the receiver is fully charged, and the operation of bottling
begins, every bottle-full that is drawn off diminishes the pressure on
the water that remains; and if no means were taken to add more gas, the
soda-water would gradually become weaker and weaker as each bottle was
drawn off. It is usual, in the best arranged apparatus, to have two
tubes connected with the force-pump, one of which feeds it with water,
the other with gas, by which contrivance water and gas, in their proper
proportions, are continually forced into the receiver, which may thus
be always kept nearly full.

The process of bottling requires great manual dexterity. The neck of
the bottle is pressed by a lever against a collar of leather fixed to
a flange on the tap, so that, when the soda-water rushes in, no air
nor gas can escape. The pressure inside the bottle therefore quickly
becomes equal to that of the receiver, and the water ceases to flow
through the tap, until some of the air is allowed to escape. When the
bottle is nearly full, the operator quickly withdraws it with one hand,
and having a cork ready in the other, he puts it in before the water
can rush out. The cork is then forced in further by pressure, and
fastened down by wires or strings.

A bottling apparatus has been invented for facilitating the process;
but a man accustomed to bottle by hand can do it more quickly, and with
as little waste of gas and water as with a machine. Much depends,
however, upon the state of the soda-water in the receiver; for if the
gas be well digested, and the temperature low, it rushes into the
bottle with much less force, though the water may contain a greater
quantity of gas, than when it is newly made, and apparently more brisk.
The bottles very frequently burst during the operation with great
violence, and unless they are enclosed in a guard, the men are liable
to be severely injured. Glass bottles have now generally supplanted
those made of earthenware, which were formerly used; and though the
glass bottles are much stronger than the earthenware ones, the bursting
of them, when it does occur, is far more dangerous.

The process of forcing gas into the water by mechanical pressure,
in the manner described, requires great labour, for the pump has to
be worked against a pressure exceeding fifty pounds on the square
inch. With a view to remove that inconvenience, and to avoid the use
of costly machinery, so that private individuals might manufacture
soda-water, the author contrived a modification of Nooth's apparatus,
for which he obtained a patent in 1831. By that means, the gas is
generated in a closed vessel, and forces itself into the water by
its own elasticity. Any amount of pressure can thus be obtained by
chemical action alone. The accompanying woodcut represents a section
of the apparatus in its improved form. The vessel, A, is made of very
strong stone ware, inside which is the gas generator _b_. A few inches
from the bottom of the generator is the partition, _a_, perforated
with holes, and near the top there is inserted the small tube, _c_,
which conveys the gas down to a perforated expansion of the tube,
_d_, through the apertures of which the gas issues into the water
contained in A. Another tube, _e_, reaches near the bottom, and is
connected with a stop-cock for the purpose of drawing off the aerated
liquid. In charging the apparatus, the interior, A, is nearly filled
with water, or other liquid, through the opening, _f_, which is then
closed by cork, which is kept in its place by a screw nut. A few
ounces of carbonate of soda, mixed with water, are then poured into
the generator through the opening at _g_. The mixture flows through
the apertures in the partition, and occupies the lower part of the
generator. A proportionate quantity (about three-fourths of the weight
of the soda) of tartaric acid in crystals is then introduced through
_g_, which lodge on the top of the partition without touching the soda.
The opening being then closed by a screw-nut, the apparatus, which is
mounted on pivots, with an appropriate stand, is swung backwards and
forwards like a pendulum. The effect of this agitation is to force
a portion of the water saturated with carbonate of soda through the
apertures at _a_, where it comes in contact with the tartaric acid,
and instantly generates carbonic acid gas. The gas, having no other
escape than through the tube, _c_, is forced into the vessel A, and
becomes mingled with the water by the same act of vibration that brings
the soda and tartaric acid together. The continuance of the vibratory
action for a short time generates sufficient gas to aerate the water
or other liquid contained in the vessel, A. When the aeration is
completed, the soda-water may be drawn off, as required, through the
stop-cock. The apparatus is made of two sizes, to hold one and two
gallons.

[Illustration]

The tartaric acid and soda in the generator do not mingle with the
water, and the tartrate of soda, resulting from the combination, is
emptied after the soda-water is drawn off, before renewing the charge.

A French modification of this apparatus, in glass vessels protected by
cane netting, called a "gasogene," has recently been introduced, and is
extensively used. The materials for generating the carbonic acid gas
are put into the smaller vessels, and kept separate until the apparatus
is inverted, and then gas is rapidly generated, and forces itself
through the water.

The powders that are sold for making soda-water, by mixing them
together, consist of carbonate of soda and tartaric acid. When brought
together in solution, a violent effervescence ensues, but the gas is
not combined with the water in the same manner as when it is forced
in and allowed to remain for some time with the liquid to be aerated.
There is the further disadvantage attending such powders, that the
tartrate of soda, formed by the tartaric acid and the carbonate of
soda, employed to generate the gas, is drunk with the water.




REVOLVERS AND MINIE RIFLES.


"Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath
been already of old time, which was before us."[18] This observation
of Solomon, the correctness of which we have often seen verified in
this History of Inventions, is applicable even to that great apparent
novelty the formidable "Revolver"--that death-dealing weapon, which
will fire six shots in rapid succession by merely pulling the trigger
so many times, as fast as it is possible.

The Revolver was almost unknown in this country until 1851, when it
was brought prominently into notice at the Great Exhibition, by the
specimens shown there by Colonel Colt, of the United States. Pistols
with six barrels, which might be fired successively with the same lock,
by turning them round, were, indeed, previously seen in gun-shops;
but their clumsy form and their great weight prevented them from
being used. Nor was Colonel Colt much more successful in his earlier
attempts to bring his Revolver into public notice. He obtained his
first patent in America in 1835, and established a manufactory for
the pistols at Paterson, United States, where he expended £35,000 in
attempting to bring the fire-arm to perfection, but with no beneficial
result to himself beyond gaining costly experience. He made further
improvements in 1849, and so far perfected the weapon that it had been
used extensively in America before it was brought into notice in this
country.

When Colonel Colt came to England, he undertook to investigate the
origin of repeating fire-arms, with a view to ascertain how far he had
been anticipated; and the result of his researches was, that repeating
fire-arms, similar in principle to his own Revolver, had been invented
_four centuries before_.

He found in the Armoury of the Tower of London a matchlock gun,
supposed to have been made as early as the fifteenth century, which
very closely resembles, in the principle of its construction, the
Revolver of the present day. It has a revolving breech with four
chambers, mounted on an axis fixed parallel to the barrel, and on
that axis it may be turned round, to bring any one of the four loaded
chambers in succession in a line with the barrel, to be discharged
through it. There are notches in a flange at the fore end of the
revolving breech to receive the end of a spring, which is fixed to the
stock of the gun, for the purpose of locking the breech when a chamber
is brought round into the proper position. The hammer is split at the
end, so as to clasp a match, and to carry its ignited end down to the
priming powder when the trigger is pulled. Each chamber is provided
with a priming pan that is covered by a swing lid, and, before firing,
the lid is pushed aside by the finger, to expose the priming powder to
the action of the lighted match. If the date of this gun be correctly
stated, a very rapid advance in the art of gunnery must have been made
after the invention of gunpowder, which took place only one hundred
years previously. The want of a better mode of discharging the gun than
a lighted match was one of the chief obstacles to the introduction of
the Revolver four centuries ago.

There is also in the Tower Armoury a specimen of a repeating fire-arm
of a more recent date, though still very ancient, that presents
considerable improvement on the preceding one. It has six chambers
in the rotating breech, and is furnished with a barytes lock and one
priming pan, to fire all the chambers. The priming pan is fitted with
a sliding cover, and a vertical wheel with a serrated edge projects
into it, nearly in contact with the powder in the pan. To this wheel a
rapid motion is given by means of a trigger-spring, acting upon a lever
attached to the axis of the wheel; and the teeth of the wheel strike
against the barytes, which is brought down, previously to firing, into
contact with it, and the sparks thus emitted set fire to the powder in
the priming pan, and discharge the piece. In this instance, also, the
breech is rotated by hand.

A still further advance towards perfection in repeating fire-arms is
to be seen in the United Service Museum, where there is a pistol,
supposed to have been made in the time of Charles I., with the breech
rotated by mechanical means. In this pistol, the act of pulling back
the hammer turns the breech, containing six chambers, one-sixth part
of a revolution, and the priming powder is ignited by a flint hammer
striking against steel.

The manufacture of these fire-arms presented some practical
difficulties which could only be overcome by great care and skill in
the construction; and from the failure in this respect they were not
patronized. It was necessary, in the first place, that the loaded
chambers should be brought into an exact line with the barrel, and be
firmly retained there during the discharge. It also required great
nicety in the fitting of the breech to the barrel, to prevent the fire
from communicating to the other chambers. A further difficulty was to
prevent the spindle, whereon the breech revolved, from becoming foul
by the explosion of the powder; otherwise, after firing a few times it
would stick fast, and the gun would become useless.

The earliest patent for repeating fire-arms in this country was
obtained by James Puckle, in 1718, for a gun with a rotating breech.
There were six chambers in the breech, which was turned round by a
winch, and, when the six were fired, there was an arrangement by
which the chambered breech could be removed, and another loaded one
substituted for it. Mr. Puckle appears to have been of a poetical
turn of mind, and the specification of his patent is enlivened by the
following loyal couplet, which deserves to be quoted as a novelty in
patent records:--

      "Defending King George, our country and laws,
      Is defending yourselves and the Protestant cause."

The invention of percussion priming in 1800, by the Rev. A. J. Forsyth,
was an important step towards the perfection of fire-arms generally,
and of Revolvers in particular; for until the chambered breech could
carry round with it in a compact form the priming for each chamber, the
construction must have been clumsy, and the action uncertain.

Colonel Colt, as already stated, took out his first patent in 1835,
and in 1849 he patented the improved Revolver, which he has brought
into general use. It has six chambers in the rotating breech, and the
